Our baby was born at 37 weeks and I thought these would be great. Hospitals must get these free from Avent. I was told to use all their products but they are not satisfying to newborns nor stay in their mouth more than 10 seconds. The bottles are the same---lots of hype about breastfeeding flexibility but instead give newborns so much gas they are in pain all the time.
