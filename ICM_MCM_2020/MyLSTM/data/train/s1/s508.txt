I have extensive experience in refinishing metals; it is difficult to get paint to adhere to aluminum.<br />I power-sanded the entire interior down to bare metal.<br />Contrary to the LABEL claims, THIS PAINT DOES NOT ADHERE TO BARE METAL!!<br />Once dried, it scrapes off with your fingernail.<br />Q: The factory paint failed despite having been primed so how could this paint work with No Primer??<br />A: IT CAN'T!<br />If I were to repeat this process, I'd have first primed it with a high-temp, self-etching automotive primer.<br />Maybe then there'd be a prayer of success...<br />Bottom Line: Unless you're willing to go thru the tedious process of properly preparing AND PRIMING, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.<br />PS:  (2) Cans are required to adequately refinish the entire interior
