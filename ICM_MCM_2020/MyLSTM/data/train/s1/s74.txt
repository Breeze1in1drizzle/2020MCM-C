I suppose Amazon wants more than twenty word reviews so no one can just say, The product sucks!  But that is somewhat appropriate.  It is also true about the manufacturer's return policy.  I was looking for an extra long cord, and found this one. I hadn't planned on retracting the cord each time, as that seemed like it would shorten the time the dryer lasted.  But I did it once, and it was trouble to not get it past the red line.  The dryer handle was also was very large, and hard to hold without my hand cramping.  Still, I kept it, as the ionic feature seemed to be good for straightening out my curly hair. After less than two months, the power button died, and I could not turn it off.  I had to reset the outlet.  When I checked about returns, it would cost me $10.00 for the return, and they would only return half of the purchase price.  So I would wind up with around $5.00 for my trouble.  And I still wouldn't have a dryer to use, as I did not want to have it replaced.  I wonder if the company has this policy so no one will bother to return the item?
