I bought this as a gift for Christmas.  I really liked the idea of a power cord that would retract into the unit, and honestly, that was a key point in choosing this over other models.  Well, the retracting mechanism worked perfectly once or twice.  After that, it would take 2-3 tries to get it to retract the cord all the way.  Usually, it would stop roughly mid-way.  After a couple months of that silliness, it now won't retract more than half way no matter how much you fuss with it.  This hair dryer was barely used at all before this bad behavior started.<br /><br />Do you remember those terrible roller window shades we had back in the 70's?  You know the ones.. they were ugly white and every time you tried to make the shade go up all the way, you'd struggle?  You'd pull it a tiny bit and hope it'd release the mechanism and pull up, but instead, it'd pull out a little more each time until finally you had that sucker pulled all the way down to the floor?  Well, if you enjoyed that nice nugget of frustration, please buy this hair dryer!<br /><br />Other observations:<br />- The release button is in an awkward position, so even when this was working, it was an awkward 2-handed affair.<br />- The noise seems a little less than a typical hair dryer.  But then again, the airflow seems a little less too.  Same goes for the heat.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't believe I took the time today to get online and review a silly hair dryer.  It just frustrates me so much that I had to do it just in the hope that I might save someone else the trouble of experiencing this thing.
