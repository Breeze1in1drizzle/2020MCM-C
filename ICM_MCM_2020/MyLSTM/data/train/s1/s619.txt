The oven comes with my new Standard Pacific Home.<br />It performs OK and it is definitely not stainless steel. It's just plastic panel with stainless coated.<br />On the second week of use, the plastic film on the door control button has small bubble patches. We thought it just protective film but it is not. The bubbles kept surfacing and broke after another week of use. I called customer service and they told me it's just a cosmetic issues. They just document it and they are not going to repair or replace it. No more Whirlpool for me.
