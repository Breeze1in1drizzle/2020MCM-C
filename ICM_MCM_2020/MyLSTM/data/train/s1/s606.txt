DIFFICULT to install, even with two people, mostly the taking down of the old greasy unit. Came with a BROKEN FAN and hence no exhaust. Whirlpool sending a repairman after a week with no microwave. Will he bring the correct parts and be able to fix it?? Impossible to return as box is not a box but styrofoam and cardboard on top and bottom with shrink wrap holding it all together. If you want one of these get it at Best Buy and save $50.00.  It's now a month since we installed the unit and the fan has been replaced (part had to be ordered). Turns out we could use the microwave without the fan. All arranged thru Whirlpool with local repairman fixing it in place.
