We do not use plastic bottles or dishes with our toddler, so I was trying to find an alternative to the standard Soothies and Gumdrops. Sadly, this was not it. Our son would not take this at all. In fact, when I first gave it to him, he laughed at it after putting itin his mouth. The nipple part is HUGE, absurdly large. After my son laughed at it, I decided to suck on it, and I don't know how a baby would ever be soothed by it. Almost choked me.<br /><br />We are now using it to wean him from pacifiers, so I guess that's a positive for this one.
