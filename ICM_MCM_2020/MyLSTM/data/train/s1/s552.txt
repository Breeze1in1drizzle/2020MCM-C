DO NOT BUY!<br />We just got the SE error after 2.5 years - they know about the problem and haven't fixed it.  I looked it up on the internet after this happened and tons of people have this problem.  I'm not going to pull the whole thing apart to fix it and then have it happen again.  If they know the moisture causes the key pad to fail then why do they have it above a range where you boil water!
