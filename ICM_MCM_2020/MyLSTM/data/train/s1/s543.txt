Do not buy a Samsung Microwave.  Purchased smh1816w January 2013 and in December 2013 stopped working have had 6 service calls and as of April 29 2014 still not working.  A&E service has replaced all parts multiple times to try to correct problem however with no luck.  Samsung is unwilling to replace the unit or refund the money paid which would be preferred. I will never purchase a Samsung product again.
