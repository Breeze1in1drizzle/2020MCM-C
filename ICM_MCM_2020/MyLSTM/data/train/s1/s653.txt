I purchased this and was only able to use it for a short two weeks, until it fell off of my diaper bag and is lost already!!  Other people's reviews stated that it fell off too easily, and I should have listened.  The strap that attaches it to the diaper bag closes with a snap, which is not AT ALL strong enough.  It falls off just from brushing against it.  Otherwise, it would have been a great accessory.
