Not good. Every time I wash this thing under running tap water, the water gets collected inside it. Very annoying to have water sitting in the little cavity when I want to use the pacifier. Now I just wipe these with the pacifier wipes, but AGAIN - washing should be the first and an easy option thou, sorry to say; with this one it isn't.
