This is the first 1 star review I have ever written. This blow dryer worked fine for 18 months. However I heard a shriek upstairs when my wife was drying her hair. She said it was on fire and she had unplugged it. I could smell the burning smell. Later that day I started wondering why it hadn't blown a breaker and decided that possible lint had accumulated and touched the burner wire. I did clean out some lint and turned on the dryer to see if I had solved problem. No!  After about 10 seconds smoke came out, there was a burning smell, and the handle got hot. Obviously this is the last of this product for us. The warranty is out by 6 months and if it had just quit working that is one thing. But this is a safety issue and the product should be recalled.
