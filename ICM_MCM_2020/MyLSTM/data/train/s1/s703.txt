I bought one of these for our little guy since it was the same paci he had used at the hospital and it looked very cute. He really seemed to like it for the twelve hours we had it before my dog got a hold of the paci and chewed it (new mom, still learning:). To my dismay, you can't change out the paci...so you are stuck. Basically, you are paying for one REALLY expensive (albeit cute) pacifier. There are other brands out there that allow you to change out the pacifier. We returned this (excellent customer service) and bought a paci-plushi monkey and are very happy with it.
