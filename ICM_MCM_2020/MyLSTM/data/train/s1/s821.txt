After much research, I came across the Ulubulu website that claims their pacifiers are bite-proof.<br />Since my little one is chewing holes through her pacis every day you can guess my frantic attempt to locate the most hardy and toughest pacifiers in the market. Hence Ulubulu came about. Why, the first day she used it, she bit through it. So where's the bite-proof feature?? Planning to return it to Amazon. Don't buy or waste your $$$. Besides that acclaimed feature, nothing special about it - just ordinary looking and I hate the ring handle, and the words inscribed on them - not witty in the least bit.
