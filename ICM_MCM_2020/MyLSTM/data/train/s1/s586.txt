In all seriousness... shame on you GE.<br />I purchased this microwave a little more than a year ago. And of course it is now out of warrantee. And thus falling apart... LITERALLY!<br />The &#34;metal&#34; handle is not actually metal, it is cheap plastic with metallic-looking tape on it. And the tape is peeling off. When i called GE they said &#34;it's probably due to the heat from the stove below.&#34; I told them, &#34;It's an over-the-range microwave!!! It should not fall apart because of heat.&#34; To which they replied, &#34;Sorry. New handle is $100 bucks plus another $100 for someone to come out and install it.&#34;<br />I wish I could post a picture of the defective part here but the site doesn't allow me.<br />After a lifetime of thinking GE was the go-to brand for good quality products... this microwave will be the last GE appliance i ever buy.
