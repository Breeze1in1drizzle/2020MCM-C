Don't waste your money. I bought this for my 14 yr old daughter for Christmas. She was very disappointed & so was I ! It has only been used or attempted to use just once. After 5 minutes of frustration my daughter gave up trying to dry her hair saying that &#34;it just doesn't get hard or blow hardly any air.&#34;  We're keeping it to blow dry our dog, a small pekingese. Other than that, it's useless.  Again, save your money & skip this product
