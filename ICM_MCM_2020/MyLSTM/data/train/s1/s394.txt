This machine's finish quality was off out of the box.  The door didn't quite line up with it's case when closed and there were a couple small dents on the lower left of the door as well.    These were tolerable, however, as long as the machine worked - and it did... sometimes.    For example, from the start this machine would occasionally shut off mid-cooking, as in the timer would go blank, the light would go out, and the food would still be pretty cold.      Other times the food would seem to be heating up pretty well but then the machine would shut off.  On those occasions we thought it might have quit because it was getting too much steam on its sensors (wherever they might have been) so we would wrap foods extremely tightly with plastic wrap - still to no avail.      On still other occasions the food **looked** like it was being cooked (light stayed on, the table rotated, the timer counted down, and tone sounded at the end) but then it would turn out to be only ever so slightly warmer than when originally put in.    After a year of our just making do with this machine's cranky behavior and then just planning our meals without microwave use it died altogether.    My wife and I can only say, Good riddance! in response.    Consumer Reports lists this microwave as a best buy and, honestly, that's why I bought it in the first place.  Unfortunately, this machine is far, far, far from being a good buy much less a Best Buy!!!  Based on my experience and those of the others who wrote in here I won't be touching a GE microwave for years, if then.
