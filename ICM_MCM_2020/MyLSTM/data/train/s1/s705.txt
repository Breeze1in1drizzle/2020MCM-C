We purchased 2 separate wubbanubs and were dissatisfied with both of them.  They both began popping seams and stuffing coming out of them within the first 3 weeks.  Out child was 3 weeks old and obviously not harming them in any way... just poor poor quality! Then when contacting the company and dealing with them they sent another... which has ZERO stuffing in it... they asked to send us another but after 3 out of 4 wubbanubs being broken we had had enough!
