I happened to notice that the base and the handle has dozens upon dozens of cracks in the finish. It looks awful. This product is less than a year old. I have had other hairdryers for years and years with no problems. Since I didn't notice the cracks within the one month return policy, I cannot even return the product. Since I don't dry my hair with my glasses on, I guess I lose out by not noticing this flaw within the return policy period. If you don't care how awful the dryer looks after it has been used, this is the product for you. It's a great product but it now looks terrible. The folks at Conair really should step up to the problem and make things right with the consumers.
