I've had this microwave for 26 months. In that time I replaced the light under the microwave maybe 4 times. Sometimes it burned out, other times it exploded, but it seemed odd that that thing kept going. My previous cheapo microwave worked for 5 years and only needed the bulb changed twice.<br /><br />Then last night the light popped and the microwave blew the fuse. Since then, the fan and light have completely stopped working. The oven itself still works, but it makes me super uncomfortable how quiet it is as it heats, does it need the fan? Does it need to vent? I don't know. But I know after all the other comments I'm not reading on Amazon, that I'm not comfortable finding out.<br /><br />When I called LG, they asked if it was plugged in. I explained that the microwave worked, but not the fan or the lightbulb. She said it was probably my outlet. Not very helpful. When I called a repairman, he said fixing it would cost $200. Ugh, looks like I&#34;m in the market for a new microwave.
