My baby likes his Avent paci just fine, but I bought this one to try it out since it is more natural nipple shaped than the Avent.  He takes it initially with no problem, but cannot seem to keep it in his mouth more than a few seconds.  I had to keep popping it back in.  I really did give it many tries, but the problem persists.  Another downside is aesthetics.  I find it ugly and kind of creepy looking.  The Avent paci is clear, small, well ventilated and is easy to attach to a keeper.  I couldn't figure out how to attach the Soothie to the kind of keeper I have.  Needless to say, I'm staying with the Avent.  Plus, the Avent comes with a cover to keep it clean. To each their own, however.  Baby will have to decide, not mom and dad!
