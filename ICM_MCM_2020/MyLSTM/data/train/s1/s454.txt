Same as the other one star reviews. Less than 2 years, panel fried for no reason (overnight, we werent even using it at the time!) Not under warranty and almost $200 to fix a $800 appliance. Fifty dollar microwaves last way longer than this! We are paying to fix, but if it haopens again, we will just put a regular microwave in that space.
