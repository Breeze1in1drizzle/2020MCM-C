This is by far the MOST stupid appliance I have ever come across in all my years.  As you will read in other reviews, the absurdity of its functions has yet to cease angering me on a daily basis.<br /><br />The 3 beeps when things are done cooking - You can not do ANYTHING until it slowly finishes its 3 beeps.  No stop, no cancel, no starting the microwave again or adding time.  You must stand there and listen to its siren song of idiocy.<br /><br />Also, you can't use the timer and use the microwave at the same time. I mean, why?! WTF!<br /><br />Daily I want to rip this thing off the wall and take it into a field Office Space style and beat it with a baseball bat.<br /><br />Anyone want to buy a microwave from me? Cheap!
