This microwave was new to my home when I moved in. After 18 months, the door switch broke: Which meant that any time the door was shut, the microwave spontaneously turned itself on (and didn't turn off until the door was opened). Fortunately, this occurred while we were home -- otherwise the microwave might have started a huge fire from continuously running empty! Because  it was out of warranty, Frigidaire customer service was ridiculously unhelpful; the representative told me that I would have to pay $150.00 just to send someone out to confirm what the problem was, and then pay for additional parts and labor to fix it! Instead I ditched the piece of garbage and bought a Samsung. I would NEVER buy a Frigidaire product again. P.S. I also had a similar experience with my two year-old Frigidaire gas range, where the glass oven door spontaneously shattered while sitting idle. Run fast and far from Frigidaire.
