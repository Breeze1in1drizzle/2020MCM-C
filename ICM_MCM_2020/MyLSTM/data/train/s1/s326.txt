this dryer arrived in an &#34;icky&#34; plastic bag inside the 'banged up' product box.  The cord was unwrapped and stuffed willy-nilly inside the bag.  The dryer had scratches and smudges on it.  It had obviously been used and returned.  There was no instruction manual included, either.  The dryer may be a good dryer but I didn't want to touch an obviously used personal item.  I am just appalled that such a product was sent to a customer.  Very disappointed.
