I don't usually write reviews but felt I ought to share my experience. I loved natursutten pacifiers because they were safe and natural and my baby also loved them. He has been using them since birth and he is now 15 months old. Today, however, I found him with pieces of broken pacifier in his hands. He had somehow split the handle part and was playing with choking hazard size pieces. This is definitely not a safe scenario. I'm planning to call natursutten but figured I should also let potential buyers know. These pacifiers are great- but if the child can break them they are very unsafe...
