How did our landlord get all new appliances and choose this awful contraption?!? The incessant beeping is driving me a little mad and, of course, there's no way to change that. Reviews for this thing being awful go back to 2-4 years ago. Just a little internet search could have saved me from this fate. I hope it dies soon.
