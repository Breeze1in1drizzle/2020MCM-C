This product looked like a great idea, to help parents with sterilizing pacifiers that fall on the ground over and over and over. It was amazing to see the pacifier ready to use in just a few minutes. But the quality of this item is very poor! It stopped working after only a week of use, and it was already presenting some problems since day 3... My wife got really upset, and we are trying to return the item.
