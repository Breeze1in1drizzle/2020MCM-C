Have owned this microwave for about 2.5 years. Has been a great performer albeit a bit longer cooking times because of it's low wattage. However, about 6 months ago the interior paint began to chip. There is now about one third of the inside paint missing. Have read numerous complaints regarding this problem on other sites so ours is not an isolated incidence. Most consumer info that is available states that the chipping paint is not unsafe. I don't know about you but I don't prefer my food with paint chips in it. I'm sure soon it will start sparking from all of the exposed metal. Haven't replaced it yet as we can't find a replacement to fit our space requirements.
