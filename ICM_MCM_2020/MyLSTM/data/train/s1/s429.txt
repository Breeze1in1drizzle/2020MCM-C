This is an absolute crappy microwave. I'm thankful I didn't spend a dime on it since it was a Christmas Present. The entire appliance is shoddy. After using it for about a year, the door handle began to show cracks and eventually just cracked completely which compromised the glass panel on the front door. Eventually the entire circuit board shorted out when I was simply changing the light bulb. My husband and I did not misuse this appliance and we certainly  weren't &#34; hard&#34; on it. It's simply a poorly made appliance.
