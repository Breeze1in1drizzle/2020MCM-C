I order this product because I love the skiphop brand. I have their diaper bag and thought the pacifier pocket would be great to go along with it. From day one I noticed the button on the strap was not the best and I read from the reviews other people had the same problem. But, I really wanted the product to work.... needless to say my pacifier pocket and pacifiers are somewhere in NYC.
