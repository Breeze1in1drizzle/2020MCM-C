While I love the look of these pacifiers and my baby is very comfortable using them, their design is terrible and down right dangerous. These pacifiers cannot be thoroughly cleaned or used by a drooling baby without water/condensation/saliva getting trapped inside. There is no way to effectively dry up this water/condensation as these pacifiers do not come apart. I recently noticed black mildew growing inside all 4 of my babies Avent Translucent Orthodontic Infant Pacifiers. I have since thrown them away. There should never be holes or crevices on these pacifiers to allow for moisture to collect in areas that cannot be effectively cleaned and dried. Very disappointing.
