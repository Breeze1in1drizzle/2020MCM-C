So here's the deal...any of the Nuk pacifiers which are plain colors...pink green white etc-dont buy!  They collect water inside and you will never squeeze it out or drain it out.  Some reviews Ive read on line say you can but trust me, water stays inside.  We have thrown out probaby about 8 of these.  I cant imagine that dirty old water and soap is good for my baby to suck on.  My baby LOVES the shape of these pacifiers so we were fortunate to discover that the ones with decorative print on the front (flowers etc)are made differently and dont collect water!  I wish I had taken the time to write to Nuk and send all of those faulty ones back.  I am surprised they are still selling these in the market.  There should be a major recall!
