this blow dryer is good at first but it's quite tricky. The blow dryer begins getting very smokey .. Something about the smell of the blow dryer doesn't seem right . I wish I listened to the reviews because the blow dryer died after one month and a day. A lot of smoke and fire flames came out of the blow dryer. Very scary . Do not but this blow dryer it may be okay at first but once you start smelling the burnt smell tuh better think twice when the return days are up. Waste of money! Do not buy this item. Going to stick to the cheap blow dryers. This was expensive for no reason perhaps maybe the watts? ( 1900 ) only good thing about this blow dryer it speeds up your drying time a+ for that.
