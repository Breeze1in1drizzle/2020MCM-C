I used this type of dryer at my brother's house and recall it feeling powerful and pretty hot, even at a low setting - exactly what I was looking for in a new dryer.    Then i ordered one for myself and got a fairly crappy dryer that didn't get warm enough at a low speed setting and didn't feel powerful at all... My only impression is disappointment. I would not recommend this dryer for anyone looking for a quality dryer.
