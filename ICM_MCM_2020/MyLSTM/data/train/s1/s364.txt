Bonnet is so rediculously small it could not be placed on head of adult, let alone dry hair on rollers.I can't imagine what the &#34;professional&#34; is, certainly not a hair salon with this &#34;quality!&#34;  Disappointing.  Time consuming. Received when I got home 5/7. Diirected by Amazon to be returned by 5/7!  Silly waste.
