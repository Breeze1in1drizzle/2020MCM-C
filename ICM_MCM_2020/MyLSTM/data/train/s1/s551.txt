My Samsung microwave worked fine until recently. It beeps!  It even starts beeping in the middle of the night.  I've unplugged and reset clock several times.  Now I have to unplug it after every use, and reset to use again.  Samsung online representative says if resetting doesn't work he would send a serviceman.  That would probably cost more than a new microwave.  I'll be searching for an new one.......definitely NOT a Samsung!
