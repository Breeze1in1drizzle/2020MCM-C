First, I was very much unimpressed by this hair dryer. Given its price, I was expecting something significantly better than a 20 dollar dryer -- NONE. And it's no featherweight, it's heavier than my previous one.    Second, I found that I couldn't register this product because its lack of the serial number. Though on the manual, it specifically says if the serial number is missing, it might not be authentic. So here goes the warranty comes with the bespoke itself. But I reasoned it must still be authentic since it's sold by amazon..      Third, I went to sephora and found this one on shelf. Man, the one in sephora, though looked exactly like this one I had, but it's real featherweighted -- just by this, I didn't even need to try out the functionality of that one in sephora to understand I have got this fake one from Amazon.    Amazon tried to charge me restocking fee for this one that is fake. I need a resolution!!    Please don't buy, it's fake.
