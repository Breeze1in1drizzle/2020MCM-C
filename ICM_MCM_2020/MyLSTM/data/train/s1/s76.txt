I know you get what you pay for but this was ridiculous.  I liked the retractable cord and the folding handle so much that I purchased another one when my first shorted out.  This morning my second one was completely dead.  And I had a soaking wet head and 20 minutes to get ready for work.  It doesn't get much worse.  I'm not rough with it and each lasted less than a year.<br />This thing is simply not reliable.  I shouldn't have tried it twice.<br />Do not recommend.
