Worst blow dryer I have ever purchased.  The attachments do not slide on well, it does not dry my hair well, and the bristles on the brush aren't stiff enough.  Unfortunately I missed my window to return the item. I'll have to buy another brand and will just keep this one in the garage if I ever need to blow something dry.  At least it wasn't very expensive.
