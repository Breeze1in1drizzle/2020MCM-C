Cons: Low speed is too low, high speed is too high.  It doesn't blow hot air for the first 5 minutes.  Speed button is hard to control quickly, I always go past the off when I want it to switch off.  It reminds me of cheap hotel blow dryers.  The back doesn't have a filter, so my hair gets stuck in it if I turn wrong.<br /><br />Pros: It was cheap.  It's lightweight.<br /><br />Just pay $3 more for the better model.
