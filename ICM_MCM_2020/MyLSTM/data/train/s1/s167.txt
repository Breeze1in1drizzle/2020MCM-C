This hair dryer is awful!  I have super thick hair and it takes a long time to dry.  I chose it because it is a high power hairdryer and has the tool on the end to focus on each section of hair (speeds drying time for me).  When on the 'high' airflow setting, it constantly shifts to low airflow power after just a couple seconds & then goes back and forth, high to low..increasing my drying time significantly.
