If this GE Profile Microwave is built like its cousin, the PVM1870, beware of the worst quality control and internal components possible.  In the two years we have owned a PVM1870 Profile, it has had 6 service calls and about every electronic part but the magnetron has been replaced, several components have been replaced TWICE.  I can accept and understand an electronic component failing, but not that many with some replaced twice -- does NOT speak well of either quality internal components, quality internal engineering or quality control.  The only reason that I gave it one star is that a zero star rating is not possible.<br /><br />Addendum:<br />The motor/power supply burned up AGAIN -- plus another service call for the vent door not opening any longer.  Now we are up to 8 service calls on the extended warranty.  This GE product is an ABSOLUTE PIECE OF JUNK and the last GE product we will ever own.  BTW -- the service personnel are excellent and know their jobs -- it is strictly the lack of build quality and quality control for this GE product that has caused so many failures.  It does not deserve ANY stars in the rating.
