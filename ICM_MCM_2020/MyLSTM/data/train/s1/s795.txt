I purchased the Safety 1st Comfort Check Thermometer with the bonus Pacifier Medicine Dispenser because my 6 month old daughter has some medication she needs to take, and at first glance it seemed like it was going to work great. I was wrong. This product is NOT SAFE AT ALL!! There is no valve to help slow the flow of medicine that comes out. I may as well have just poured the medicine down her throat! She choked on the medicine because it just came pouring out of the nipple! How this product was tested and approved amazes me. This is a trash product and needs to be taken off the market.
