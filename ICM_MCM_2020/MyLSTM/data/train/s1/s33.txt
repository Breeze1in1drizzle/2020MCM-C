I purchased this item a few months ago because I wanted a soft bonnet dryer to replace my old dryer. The price seemed reasonable. I did not have the problems several other customers experienced with the dryer stopping and then restarting.  At least their's restarted. My unit just died on me while drying my hair. I was never able to get it restarted. I had owned the unit for only a few months so I did not think Amazon would accept a late return. The storing of the tubing, bonnet and cord was very difficult with each use. The space was too small to accomodate everything. The medium setting tended to be very hot. I wish I had read the other reviews prior to purchasing. I am now stuck without a hair dryer at home. This item was a complete waste of money. Please DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.
