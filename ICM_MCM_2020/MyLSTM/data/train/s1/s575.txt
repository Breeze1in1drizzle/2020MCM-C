I'm working on my second one of these. I returned the first one because I thought it was defective. It now turns out that they ALL are. If you set the time for more than a minute or two (I discovered this with a 4 minute cook time), at the end of the time, the clock cycles and then the micro starts running again for 30 MINUTES! After a week or so, I noticed that it was also starting up by itself even if it hadn't been used for a while. Major fire hazard! I had to start unplugging it between uses. Meanwhile, dealer would not take it back. I had to go through Whirlpool. They have non-existent customer service! They say they are going to call and never do. They say they are replacing it but it will be at least three weeks and then no one ever shows up. The dealer finally agreed to give me another one and deal with Whirlpool themselves. But now I find that the new one does the same thing: on longer cook times (e.g., 4.5 minutes), it starts up again for 30 minutes. I fear it will start turning itself on again. Has anyone had this same experience? Does anyone know of a fix? I'm being forced to replace it with some other model after only a few weeks because it scares me.
