My daughter loved the feel of this pacifier and did not want to part with it. I love that they are made from natural rubber. They do, however, wear out super fast. After a month of use, the loop broke and the nipple was coming apart from the ring (CHOKING HAZARD!). I would replace it each month, but soon got tired of that, especially since they are pricey. I switched to MAM pacifiers and have had no issues with durability, plus my daughter loves her MAMs, too.
