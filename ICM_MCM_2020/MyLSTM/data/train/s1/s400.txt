Man I wish I'd read these reviews before buying this. I was at a local Big Box store and saw this on the shelf, decided to buy it on impulse.  After all, it's a GE and that's a great brand, right?<br />It was disappointing from the start. I don't use a microwave for much other that popcorn and heating freezer meals, and it couldn't even handle those. The popcorn setting burned the popcorn (my old, cheapo Sharp would always stop at just the right time.)  The meals were heated unevenly.<br />And now, after less than a month of very light use, the display flickers and it refuses to turn on.<br />After reading these reviews I decided it wasn't even worth repairing. I've junked it and bought a highly rated Panasonic from Amazon (along with a 3-year Square Trade warranty).<br />What a piece of junk!
