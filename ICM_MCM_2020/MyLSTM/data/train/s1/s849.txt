why there is not easy &#34;handle&#34;?<br /><br />Without handle it is difficult to manipulate for both me and my child. Not practical to put it in and pull it out. The standard &#34;pacifier chains&#34; do not work with this one, you need to buy the MAM chain!<br />I do not like this obligation.<br />Result: without chain it keeps falling on the floor...<br />what a poor design!<br /><br />We turned to pacifiers made entirely of silicone (even the handle and the outside). They are super soft and flexible, easy to handle. Friends sent them to us from Italy, I do not know if they exist here. I think Chicco makes them. My baby adores them because he can chew the entire thing during teething spells.
