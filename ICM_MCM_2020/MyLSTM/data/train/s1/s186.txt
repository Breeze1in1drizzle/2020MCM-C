The velvety outer coating on the hairdryer started to peel off after about three weeks. It rubbed off around the handle and nozzle, flinging bits of the paint (or whatever that was) into my hair and on my floor-- one day I tried to just rub all of it off but it just made a bigger mess.<br /><br />The dryer itself was just fine, just that damn clear coating paint looked awful and got all over the place. The only thing I can liken it to is one of those clear facial masks that you can peel off. I ended up having to buy a new hairdryer a month after buying this one.<br /><br />Buy another model.
