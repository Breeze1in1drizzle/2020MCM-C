I was given this binky at the hospital, didn't read the packaging and therefore didn't know that this was only for babies 0-3 months. My 6 month old put the whole thing in his mouth and thank God I was right there because I was able to get it out before he suffocated! I threw it away immediately and want to warn other parents about the dangers of giving this to an older baby.
