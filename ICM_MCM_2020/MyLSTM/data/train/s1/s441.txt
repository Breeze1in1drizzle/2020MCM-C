We really enjoyed using this microwave while it lasted; however, after 2 1/2 years of use it just stopped working one day. We chose this drawer-type microwave because we wanted to &#34;hide&#34; our microwave in our island for aesthetic purposes, and for this reason, were willing to pay more for it.  If I could do it again, I would definitely have splurged for one of the more expensive drawer microwaves that are available from manufacturers other than Sharp.  Yes, Sharp makes the cheapest version of this type of microwave, but we learned the hard way that you get what you pay for.
