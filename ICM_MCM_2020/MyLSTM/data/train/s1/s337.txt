The one thing I do want to give them credit for is fast shipping. Now! on another note, the first bonnet I received came without the cord. I contacted the company and they immediately got back to me stating that they would send me another bonnet. Now the second bonnet really made me upset because it was damaged. The main thing that made me upset is how eager I was to get the purchase and both attempts failed. They replied stating they would send me out another one but I realized that if they couldn't get it together the first two times, I was afraid to see what the third would be. They need to reevaluate their packaging procedure for a more accurate outcome on products. I'm very disappointed and would never purchase from this company ever again. Never had an issue like this throughout my years of purchasing items through amazon!
