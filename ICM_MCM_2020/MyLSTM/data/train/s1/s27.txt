I agree with all the criticisms of this dryer plus one more. Adjustable? Huh? You can adjust your height under it but no instructions and no intuitive way to adjust the hight of the dryer. I have the more expensive Conair model as well and made the mistake of buying this one to keep at my kids' house for when I visit.
