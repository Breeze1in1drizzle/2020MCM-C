Cheaply made materials. My daughter (2) just got hers. It cracked when she stepped on it ,and the second one got a hole in it from her just nibbling it (she nibbles at her MAM pacifiers all the time, and has ten of those. None of them have a single bit of damage from her nibbling.). In my opinion, it's a bit pricey for not too good of a product.
