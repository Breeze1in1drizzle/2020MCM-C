I have had this microwave for 1 year now, it has broken 3 times and Sharp has been terrible about getting it fixed under the warranty.  Opening / shutting the drawer is very sensitive & therefore the drawer stops working.  No turntable which means you need to manually spin your food around as needed.  Overly complicated directions.  Too expensive for what you get!
