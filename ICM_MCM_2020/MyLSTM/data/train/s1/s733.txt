As soon as I put this in my daughters mouth she began to choke. I turned her over and had to pat her back and watch her choke. She was gasping for air as I was screaming and crying. Why would they make this product for infants!!! She coughed her medicine up with her foamy saliva. I was so terrified. She started to turn red and i just cradled her in my arms when she began breathing again. If I could give this product ZERO stars I WOULD!! Do not waste your money or put your child's life in danger!!
