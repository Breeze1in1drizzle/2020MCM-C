I ordered this Conair Hair Dryer back in June of 2012.  I have had many Conair hair dryers over the years and have always been very happy with them.  I would get many years of use out of them before they finally succumbed.  When my previous hair dryer died I again wanted a Conair since I had good luck with them so I ordered this one.  I loved this dryer all the way up until today.  While drying my hair it just died after about 5 minutes of use.  My hair is not long, just below my shoulder, and usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to completely dry depending on time of year.  I thought that maybe I just blew the ALCI so I followed the Operating Instructions to try and reset it.  No luck.  So I let it sit for a couple of hours to then try again....still no luck.  It is dead.  Again, I have had other Conair hair dryers that lasted for many years with no problems.<br />So because this particular dryer only lasting just under 13 months I am giving it the one star.  I haven't given up on Conair.  I will continue to buy Conair hoping my next one will last longer.
