I bought this microwave a few years back. Broke a year ago, waited a year to get it fix. This morning technician replaced inverter, worked......than he noticed it was on and off heating. Didn't warm up a cup of water. Told me the magnetron would need to be replaced. All about $500. STAY AWAY! Can't believe I spent $1,000 on this and 3 years later it's near the curb.......damn.....what an idiot I am....thanks Whirlpool...
