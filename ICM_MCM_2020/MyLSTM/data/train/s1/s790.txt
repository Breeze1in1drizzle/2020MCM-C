This was purchased as a gift on my sister's baby registry. The product pictured shows four pacifiers in pastel colors. While the description does say you only get two, it doesn't say they are CLEAR, not pastel-colored.<br /><br />I can't comment on the quality of the product... I just want other purchasers to know they will be receiving two clear pacifiers. The product picture is indeed misleading, and should be changed.
