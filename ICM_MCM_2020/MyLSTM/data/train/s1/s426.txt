I bought this LG microwave (LMV1680ST) as part of a full kitchen remodel a year ago. Upon first use, the microwave sparked and then made an unusually loud humming when on. Nothing heated. It broke on the first use. Home Depot, of course, said LG had to come out to deal with it. Since it was installed and not something I could easily take back to the store, I had to contact LG and schedule first a service consultation and THEN a service. What a pain. Now, less than a year later, the microwave is broken again. Since I bought it a few months before installation it's now out of warranty and LG wants to charge me $150 just to come out and inspect it. Don't buy it!! I threw away $200 on it and will just have to replace aNd pay for ANOTHER installation.
