My husband and I purchased this on 5/27/13 .... the product has never worked.  I have been calling samsung for weeks and still the product doesn't work. Samsung has the worst customer service I have ever delt with. I am just trying to get a refund at this point.  I ask that they come and get it because,  I already paid to have it installed. ... I don't think I should have to pay to have taken out too. They said they will not send anyone and if I want a refund I have to send the plug and serial number . Again... just come and get it. Product is bad but the company is awful.  BBB rating for samsung appliances is an F wish I knew that before
