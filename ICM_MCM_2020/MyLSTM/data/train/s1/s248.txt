This hair dryer is powerful and does an excellent job. However, I bought one for my wife which I received on January 7th 2014. My wife used it 4 times and then it burned. Literally there was smoke coming from the back of the unit and it stopped working. I contacted Amazon and they are sending a replacement unit. It could be that the unit was defective and the replacement will last longer. But, my rating will stay as 1 star until we can proof otherwise.
