My story is so similar to the other reviews.  Bought mine in 3/2008 - loved it worked fabulous for about a year.  Just to the end of the warranty.  Whirlpool's response to my request for warranty service at 13 months on a top of the line appliance was Tough Luck - you should have bought our warranty.  I got it fixed $200.  Then I bought the warranty - $125.  Two months later, it was down again.  Over 3 months, and 4 appointments, they replaced nearly every interior part.  Finally it was fixed again.  Two weeks later.....it is down again.  Very disappointing.
