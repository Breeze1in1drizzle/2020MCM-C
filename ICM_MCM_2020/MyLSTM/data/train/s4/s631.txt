Purchased for the upstairs nursery, it has saved me from stumbling downstairs to the kitchen for late night/early morning feedings. Fits the Avent as well as the thinner bottles. I recommend using the caps that come with your bottles when you warm up junior's food (repels the condensation).<br /><br />I'd give it five stars, but the beeps are a feature that I wish could be turned off by the user - note to Munchkin.<br /><br />Worth every penny.
