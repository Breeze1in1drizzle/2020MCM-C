Baby loves it.  This is the only bottle he will take and we immediately noticed a big difference in his gassiness and fussiness.  My favorite &#34;Mom&#34; feature is the bottom screws off for easy popping it into the dishwasher.  The only downside is that unless you screw it on exactly right, it has great potential to leak, and costs one star.  The pacifiers are great as they are smaller than regular pacifiers and perfect for the new babies.
