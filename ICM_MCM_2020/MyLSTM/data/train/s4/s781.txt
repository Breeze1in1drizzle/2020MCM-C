My daughter loves these pacifiers and it's the only kind she'll take.  My son used to love avent pacifiers too.  However, i'm alittle disappointed i couldn't choose what design i wanted.  I really wanted the cat and lamb ones since we have cats and her nursery is lamb themed but we got the cow and rabbit ones.  Therefore, i only gave these 4 stars.
