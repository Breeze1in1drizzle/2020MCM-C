Great Hairdryer, affordable price, delivery was quick, like the packaging and the extra hair drying tips you get by email. Wishing it had a little bit more power in the cool blast but no big deal. Im pleased that I bought this product to replace my old hairdryer which took 20mins to dry my hair, happy to say it has cut the timing of drying my long hair down to 8minutes and leaves my hair smooth enough not to use the GHD hair irons. Only major downside is that it is quite noisy.
