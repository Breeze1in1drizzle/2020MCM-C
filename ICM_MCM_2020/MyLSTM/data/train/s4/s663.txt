I love the NUK pacifiers, but the colors they came in are horrible. A neon green and a dark pink for my son. No thank you. I went through the hassle of returning them.<br /><br />I have to update my review. They did come in horrible colors, but Amazon let me keep them, but also returned my money. I did buy NUK pacifiers again, because in my opinion they are the best. I just went to a store and bought them there to insure the color I am getting.
