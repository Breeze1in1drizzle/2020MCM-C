I don't know why my baby loves Avant Pacifiers so much, but he just does. We've tried a range of different kinds, shapes, and sizes. The Avant manages to keep him occupied the longest.<br /><br />There isn't a top or bottom, so you don't have to worry inserting it the wrong way, and they come in a range of kid-friendly colors, which helps with identifying which one to use (I don't know how many times I've asked my wife, Which one's the clean one? to which she'll reply, Use the blue one, the green one's dirty.).<br /><br />One minor annoyance, sudsy water can get trapped inside the nipple when you wash it. Rinsing it out is pretty easy, just pinch and release the nipple a few times while running it under the faucet. This seems to do the trick, even if you can't actually get in there and scrub it out. Of course, if all else fails, you can also give it a good boil to kill any germs.
