This toy is really cute and I wanted my baby to love it but she just looks at it like &#34;what is this thing?&#34; and doesn't pull on the strings at all (and she loves her pacifiers). I think the idea is great and maybe she'll take more interest in it when she's a little older but for now I think I'm enjoying it more than she is.
