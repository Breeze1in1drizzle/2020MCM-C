I've wasted my money on several hair dryers that didn't measure up because the bonnets never fit tightly. They wouldn't stay on my head properly, the heat would seep out and took hours to dry my SHORT hair.  Now, with this dryer, these problems are solved!!! It has a nice snug fit with the drawstring attachment, the heat stays in and my hair is dry in no time! I love it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the hose was longer. Other than that, it's a great product!
