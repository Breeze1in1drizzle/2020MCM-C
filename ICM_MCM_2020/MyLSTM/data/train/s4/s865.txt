The most important thing with any pacifier is that Baby likes it.  It can be cute, have a great theme, color or design, but if Baby won't use it then it's worthless.  My Grandson started off with a Philips Avent pacifier that the hospital sent home with him, but when his parents decided to introduce it he refused it. So Mom & Dad bought several to try including Nuk, Munchkin, Dr. Browns and MAM.  Overall he definitely preferred the Munchkin and that is what he has been using.  This set of two has been perfect for me to have in my home just in case they forget one when dropping him off.  I like that they are clear and that they also look a bit like a smile or heart. Overall the price is good here on Amazon and you also have a choice of colors which I found out can sometimes be an issue in the stores.
