i initially bought two other cowboys pacifiers from amazon that where 3+ months and they had little bumps on the pacifier for my baby's gums. Until someone boiled them and got water stains all in it plus the batman pacifiers i had for him as well. anyways i like these as well but they were shaped different and didnt have the bumps for ortho use. i thought they were the same pacifiers just because they only show one picture, but when i got them i was slightly disappointed but of course my baby love his pacifiers.
