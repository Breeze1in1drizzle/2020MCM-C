I came across this while searching for a pacifier holder, but thought it was INGENIOUS that they would attach a pacifier to a stuffed animal for the baby to hold.  My boy's only 6 weeks old and hasn't really gotten a grasp of holding onto things yet, but when we gave it to him, he seemed to really like it.  He already liked the SOOTHIE pacifiers so it wasn't a big deal.  I think as he gets a little older, he'll be able to hold onto the puppy better, but we think it was good for him to get a headstart and start holding onto it now.  Even when it falls out of his mouth, I like the fact that it doesn't go very far.  Sometimes he has a tendency to spit out his pacifier pretty far!      My only dislike is that you can't detach it (like with the Paci Plushies) so you could wash them separately.
