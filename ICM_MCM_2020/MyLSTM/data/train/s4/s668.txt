My firstborn LOVED this pacifier! He loved it so much, that when I finally decided to wean him off it and take it away at the age of 17, he cried for three days nonstop. I had to cut the tip off and say binky boken to get him to realize it was over and done with. Though I solved that problem, my wife was none too pleased with my actions. What's the big deal?
