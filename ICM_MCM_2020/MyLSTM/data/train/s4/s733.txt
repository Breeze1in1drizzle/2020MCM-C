Overall I am extremely pleased with these pacifiers, and will continue to buy them despite their frequent need for replacing because my little one took to them so well.<br /><br />I was able to introduce this paci to my breastfeeding newborn in week 3 with no nipple confusion (just be careful not to use it when the baby is hungry, only use it for comfort when you know he does not need to nurse, and not too often until after week 6-8). He really seems to find these soft and pliable pacifiers to be very comforting, and I like that they were designed with breastfeeding babies in mind.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they do break down rather quickly and need to be replaced about every 4-6 weeks. As a side note (an almost comical one), if you have a kitty be careful, many cats love the smell of rubber and two of our pacis have already fallen victim to our cat.
