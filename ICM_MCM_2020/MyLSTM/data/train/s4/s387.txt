I purchased this blow dryer to replace one that had gone out on me...The dryer that was sent to me must be a new version of the same product...It is now a black/purple dryer versus the red one pictured.  Although I got a little excited when I opened the box (black and purple are my favorite colors,) once I turned on the dryer, I felt the difference.  It doesn't have as much power as my old dryer.  The &#34;turbo&#34; on the old one felt like I was in a wind storm, which is exactly what it takes to dry my long hair.  On the new version, there is hardly any &#34;blow&#34; on the regular setting, and the &#34;turbo&#34; setting only increases it a little.  My quest for a fast dry time blow dryer continues....
