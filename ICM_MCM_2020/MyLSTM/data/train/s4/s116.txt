This is a simple and effective dryer for those who are space-conscious and don't want any frills.  The low setting is only useful for people with short hair as it is little more than a breeze (which works pretty well for my hair).  The high setting is powerful and would dry anything but a wookie in a fairly short time.  Great for travel as it is light and compact.  It does make a good bit of noise on high.    Not perfect, but definitely worth the price!
