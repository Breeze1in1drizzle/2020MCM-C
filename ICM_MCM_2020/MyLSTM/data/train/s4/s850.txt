I purchased these once at our local Babies R Us when they were on sale (note - Amazon is selling them for approx. $10 right now, but BRU sells them for cheaper) and my daughter took to them pretty well. She was kinda picky about her pacifiers - she did not like Soothies or Tommee Tippee at all - but these ones were fine. Her favorites were Philips Avent, so if your baby likes those, s/he may like these too. She used the 0-6 month size until she was around 8 months old.<br /><br />These held up quite well. I sterilized them in our electric sterilizer after each use. I never had to throw them away because they were worn. We usually lost them first :)
