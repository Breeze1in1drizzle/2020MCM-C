I have thick hair that is a few inches past my shoulders. I dry my hair on the high hot setting. I used this for the first time yesterday and the dryer shut off halfway through the drying process. I know it is because of the safety feature that turns it off once it is too hot. I pushed the button on the plug to reset the dyrer and it turned back on for a few more seconds of drying then shut off. I turned the heat setting down to warm and was able to finish drying my hair. I do not recommend this for anyone that has thick hair that takes a while to dry like mine. It does dry sections quickly, but not quickly enough for my hair type.
