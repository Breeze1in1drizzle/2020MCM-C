This is a very slick-looking unit, but unfortunately it doesn't heat things up fast enough, probably because it's 950 watts instead of 1100 like many others. The grill feature is a nice addition, allowing you to cook items you normally wouldn't cook  in a microwave.  Cosmetically it's a treat to look at, different than all the others out there.  You CAN see the food inside while it's cooking, but because of the black interior it's not as easy to see as others.  The front is all plastic -- stainless it's not.  The controls are nice, the push button opener is easy, the unit is relatively quiet while cooking, and overall we're quite pleased with it.  However, if you like to nuke your food in the shortest time, you should look elsewhere.
