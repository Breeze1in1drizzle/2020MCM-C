Nothing exciting here, just a pacifier holder. It goes with my bag so I thought it would be a decent addition as well as a bonus when I go to resell the bag.<br /><br />However, although it performs as expected (i.e., holds a pacifier), the snap seems to be just loose enough that it will pop off if not located inside the bag. I was hoping to get this to attach to the outside so I wouldn't have to dig for pacifiers. If I sling the bag over my shoulder and my body rubs against the pacifier pocket, it will unsnap and fall on the ground.<br /><br />Granted, the pacifier is still clean and in the bag...hence the 4 star rating instead of lower.
