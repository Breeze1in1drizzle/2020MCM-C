I bought these in the hopes they'd be a better alternative to the regular Nuk orthodontic ones which collect water in the nipple and have mold and mildew issues. These are all one piece, are easy to clean, and don't collect water in the nipple. My daughter liked them, but I wish they came in a larger size too. Also, they collect every little piece of lint. Other than that, they are great. Now that we are on to the size 2 nuks, we can't use these anymore.
