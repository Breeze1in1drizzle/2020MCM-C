I purchased this dryer for a trip to Italy & it worked perfectly.  It has a switch so I can use it in either the USA or when I travel abroad.  Please note the directions read to only use on low setting when overseas; but the air volumne was still very good & I have thick hair!  You will need an adaptor for it for international travel, but not a convertor.  Overall very good product, lightweight and durable.
