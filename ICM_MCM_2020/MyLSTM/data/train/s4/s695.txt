5 stars because it's an Avent pacifier and my son is obsessed with them... 3 stars because it doesn't glow in the dark longer than 10 minutes = median of 4 stars.<br /><br />My son loves his Avent pacifiers.  I hate being woken up in the middle of the night because he has lots his pacifier under his pillow, in his blanket, etc.  I thought that this pacifier would make finding the lost paci in the middle of the night a little easier.  That is certainly not the case.  This paci does glow when you first turn the lights out but with anything that is glow in the dark, it's not going to last too long.<br /><br />I had realistic expectations when I bought these pacifiers.  I didn't really think that they would glow all night long... I was just kinda hoping!  The win is that he loves this paci as much as any of his other Avent pacis so it still gets used.
