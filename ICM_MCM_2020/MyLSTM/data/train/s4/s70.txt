I purchased this hair dryer after watching a series of blow drying tutorials. I researched a lot about hair dryers since this was my first purchase. I wanted to invest in a decent blow dryer which would last me for atleast an year. I have wavy hair and I have recently got a layer cut done with a scoop. I understood the need of a good blow dryer to get that wow look that you get after a salon visit. I must say the elchim professional 2001 truly met all my expectations. The dryer is quite light and easily manageable by blow dry virgins. If you are planning to buy a blow dryer for the first time, then i would suggest you to go for this one. This 2000 Watt dryer is very powerful and straightens your hair instantly. All you need a Ceramic Jumbo round brush ( from Brush lab) and this powerful device to create the look you have always craved for. I am really happy with the results.My husband always admires my hair now and I simply can't stop blushing...:) I  wanted a red and black combi dryer, but they sent me a black one instead. Thats Ok. When this breaks, I'm gonna simply make another purchase of the same product.
