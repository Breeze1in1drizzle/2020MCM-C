Bonnet too tight, otherwise, excellent. The bonnet has an adjustable elastic, but it is so tight that there is no way that one would adjust it even further. It hurt my forehead, because it was so tight. What I did was cut the elastic, and then just set the bonnet on my head loosely, and it works perfectly. Nice steady hot and warm options. and high and low. So, had the bonnet not been an issue, I woudl have given this 5 stars. Must have been tiny, tiny heads when they designed it!
