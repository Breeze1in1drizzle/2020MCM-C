Great product that always draws a laugh when our baby uses Stachifier. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is due to the fact that water can get trapped inside after cleaning if you aren't careful. Still, it's worth the money and is safe as long as you are diligent. I definitely recommend the Stachifier!
