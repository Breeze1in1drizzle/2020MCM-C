These are my newborn's favorite pacifier. The price here is good, but you do not get to pick the color<br /><br />Out of 6 pacifiers I ordered, 4 had fluorescent pink on them. Oops. At least the price was right.<br /><br />So if you care what color to get, probably don't order them here. If you just want it to be pacifier to help your newborn sleep regardless of style and color, this is probably a great place to order them.
