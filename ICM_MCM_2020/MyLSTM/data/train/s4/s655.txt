I think this is a brilliant idea!  I bought this for my 3 months old who is always dropping his pacifier.  It solves that problem very well!      I also bought a paci-plushie at the same time. Paci-plushie is a pacifier holder so it works with wide variety of pacifiers so you don't have to use the soothie if your baby prefers something else.  Plus, if the paci wears out, you can just buy a new $2 pacifier rather than a whole new toy!  That just makes more sense to me.  My baby happens to gladly take whatever pacifier we give him so both work for us.  I am only knocking off a star because I think that the idea of a removable paci makes much more sense.  Wubbanub works well and has helped my LO keep his paci in place.
