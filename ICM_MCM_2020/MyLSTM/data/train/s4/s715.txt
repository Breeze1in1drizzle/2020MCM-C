Our baby likes the nipple on this paci, but it's not ideal for our infant.  Now that he's grabbing things he often pulls out the paci by tugging on the monkey.  Maybe he'll grow to hold it in his mouth as he gets older??  I don't know, but overall I still think it's a cute paci and it works most of the time.
