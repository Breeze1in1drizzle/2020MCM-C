Bought this to replace an old one that finally expired after about 4 years. There are were a few minor issues. First the power cord is much shorter than the previous one which necessitated remounting to a different wall location. Had to paint the wall to cover the repaired area. Second, there needs to be a way to dim or turn off the night lite. It is so bright you can make moves with it. A 4 1/2 star unit, 5 with light control and going back to a longer cord.
