This is a nice paci for babies who are outgrowing the regular soothie pacifier.  It is pretty big, but made out of the same materials and the nipple is the same as the regular soothies.  My baby sucked on it more than he chewed on it, but at least he wasn't able to shove the whole thing in his mouth like his old ones.
