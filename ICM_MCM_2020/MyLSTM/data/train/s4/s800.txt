I recently purchased this because I saw a mom with it and thought it was a great idea.  My daughter is 5 months and its harder to stay in her mouth now that she's moving around a lot. I would recommend this for newborn to 4 months. Also, the pacifier is the same that the hospitals give out so if your baby uses those the you will love this.
