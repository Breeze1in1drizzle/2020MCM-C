So, I got this in hopes that it would inspire me to completely blow out my hair.  Looks great when the hairdresser does it but I get bored about halfway through.  The jury is still out- three neat attachments that I have never in my life used and more options than I know what to do with- cool, warm hot and then high and low, and finally a cold burst....I'm used to just on or off!<br /><br />it is a little top heavy so not the most comfortable.  But so far so good.
