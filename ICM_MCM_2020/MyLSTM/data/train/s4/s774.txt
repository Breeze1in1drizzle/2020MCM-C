These are nice and soft and do conform well to her face without the marks left by hard backed pacis. However she does have trouble sucking on the round paci bit. She seems to have more luck with the flat pacis which may just be due to the fact she breastfeeds. However if your little one is used to sucking on a regular round nippled bottle these would probably work fine. Overall I think they are worth purchasing if your baby can suck on them. They aren't really soft,they conform to babys face nicely,and they work well and keep her content when she can manage them.
