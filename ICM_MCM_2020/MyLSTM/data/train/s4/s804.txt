My son (19 months) hates these...but I love it! He was super addicted to his paci (&#34;ya ya&#34; as he called it), but they were too small for his age and size. Enter these pacis. They are HUGE and he hates it. So he's actually self-weaning and just chucks these out of his crib and across the room. Pretty funny. My husband and I wanted to give our son the choice to use it himself. He still does use these very occasionally, but he's now happier without. With his older pacis, he would scream if we even tried to take it. These, he gives up voluntarily and easily. I don't know if that's by design? But anyways. At 19 months, he wasn't talking much with a paci in his mouth and now he has the freedom to speak his mind. Awesome. We got a pack of the soccer and a pack of the football when I ordered &#34;white&#34;. The particular sport didn't matter to us, but just thought I'd put in that detail for anyone concerned.
