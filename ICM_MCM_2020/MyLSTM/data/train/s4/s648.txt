Like the reviewer below, my baby also was sucking on her hands, her clothes...and did not like the Avent pacifiers I had bought for her. My friend told me to try a Soothie, and it worked wonders, immediately. Baby does not spit it out. It apparently is suitable for babies who breastfeed. I would have to agree that the con is the lack of a handle. There are 2 little holes in the pacifier that you could use to tie a makeshift pacifier clip string, otherwise you should get several in case it falls out and gets lost. Side note: it is very cute to watch your baby sucking on this...you can see his/her mouth working through the pacifier
