Started using these when my newborn got fussy at nights. Helped her relax very good. She likes the shape of these the best over a couple others that we've tried to use. I like that you can stick them in her mouth right side up or upside down and it doesn't matter. Also the glow in the dark feature is great. In the rare occasion she is in her bassinet at night I can look over and see the pacifier moving in her mouth or laying next the her easily. I've bought them for other mothers.
