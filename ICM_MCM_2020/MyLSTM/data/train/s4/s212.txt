Purchased this item because I'm needing to transition from no-lye relaxed 4b or 4c hair to natural hair. As stated, by many hair professionals of African American hair studies, that grade 4b or 4c hair is prone to dryness and needs plenty of moisture. So, I was looking to wash my hair then press it, but my hair takes hours to air dry; though, it appears dried once I towel dry it... it still retains water. Dampness effects my press iron, if my shafts are not free from vapor; therally. Well, I will be using and have used this dryer to quick dry my hair and afterwards press it. Both heat tools that I have now are of tourmaline and ceramic technology...I believe this system is better because they will ensure least harsh heat on my hair shafts. Glad that it adds shine to my hair and I look forward to continuous usage in the future. Yes, it's light weight and it's filter is easy to change.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars so far and leave off one because it's loud when set on high, but it's not bothersome (as with all dryers).
