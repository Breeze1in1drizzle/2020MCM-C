nice to have a timer and to control the heat.  the description didn't say how hot it gets but it says 75 Celsius and it was too hot for my girl friend and she has hair that requires a lot of heat.  Easy to put together took less than 5 minutes after unpacking everything. No fan speed on this model.  Also the description said locking wheels when I bought it and it does not have it.  Girl friend is super happy how her hair comes out with this machine and that was the whole plan.  Also the pole is spring loaded which makes it easier to adjust up but harder-er to adjust down but you don't have to be super strong to do it.  It was easy for me just wanted to mention it because I thought it was a great selling point because if it wasn't spring loaded it would suck adjusting the height.
