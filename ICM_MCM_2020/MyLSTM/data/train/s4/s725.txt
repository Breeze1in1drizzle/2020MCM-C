So I bought this to use in my diaper bag as a wet bag for when we are going places. Unfortunately, it ended up being too small to really hold the amount of diapers I would go through (I have twins.) For one baby it would probably be perfect, though! I do keep this rolled up and in my bag in case I need to stash wet clothes in them or something.<br /><br />Sadly, I never used the little paci bag.<br /><br />If I could go back, I wouldn't purchase this, but I can't give the product a few stars because... it's well made! It does its job. I just didn't need it as much as I thought I would.<br /><br />My daughter loves blowing the paci bag up like a balloon and playing with it. It's THAT waterproof. REALLY high quality! :)<br /><br />In a nutshell... for more than one baby, probably too small. For a long-day outing... probably too small. For a quick run, probably perfect! But, who wants to spend money on a bag you can only use part of the time?
