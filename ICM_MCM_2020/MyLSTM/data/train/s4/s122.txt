I like having a small, but powerful hair dryer that doesn't take up much space in the bathroom or suitcase when needed.  Would have preferred the cord to be white so it wouldn't be as noticeable in the bathroom, but just a minor disappointment.  Also, the on/off/heat setting control is a little hard to move, which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5.
