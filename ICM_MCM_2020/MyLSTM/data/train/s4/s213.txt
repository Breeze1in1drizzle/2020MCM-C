I like this hairdryer and it works well, but I should have paid attention to one of the reviews that said the control switch is in a bd place. The switch slides on the handle, right where my hand is holding the hairdryer and it does get moved around or turned off while I'm trying to dry my hair. If I had to choose all over again, I would probably buy a different one whose switch is in a different location.
