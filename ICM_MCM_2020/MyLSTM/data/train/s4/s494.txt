Warning:  For appliances, Amazon.com reviews are skewed to the low side.  Most people who write appliance reviews do so because their apppliance stopped working and they get mad and want to take it out on the company.<br /><br />The Problem:  most microwaves are made by a few Asian companies.  GE has stopped manufacturing most small appliances and even some major appliances.  Many of the GE refridgerators are not only made in Korea, they were designed and engineered by Korea and only have a GE label slapped on them.  The expensive GE Profile microwaves are made by the guys who make the Panasonic and other microwaves.<br /><br />With an appliance or piece of electronics, it can be the luck of the draw.  There is a basic reliablity curve, called the bathtup curve. In the first few months of a product's life, there is a high percentage of units that fail.  Then, if you get past that, there is a long period where the odds of your product failing is very low, until end of life is reached, maybe 10 to 20 years later.  The people who write reviews in Amazon are the unfortunate ones who products fail during that initial period.<br /><br />My microwave broke after 4 months.  But, GE customer service is great.  I called them up.  They came to my house the same day.  It needed parts the repair did not have on his truck.  He ordered the parts, which came 2 days later.  I made another appointment and my microwave was back in a week.<br /><br />This microwave is big inside.  I don't know how imporantant that is.  We can put big plates or platters in it.  But, if it wasn't so big, I could just put the food in smaller bowl.<br /><br />It has lots of heating options.  But, so do the cheapest microwaves.  Personally, I don't think any of those heating options are of any value.  It is not like they are reliable to work automatically.  With any microwave, you experiment a couple of times and then you konw what setting to use.<br /><br />Really, there are only 3 important features for amicrowave:<br /><br />1.  How it looks.  I think this looks great.<br /><br />2.  Power.  This is 1200 watts and heats food fast.  I wouldn't get anything under 1000 watts.<br /><br />3.  Quality.  Unfortunately, I don't think you can do much about this.
