I bought this M/W for use in an apartment after reading the good reviews on Amazon. Functionality and performance and even look-wise, this has been a great buy. No complaints there. But a couple of important downsides to this microwave...It is LOUD and keeps beeping even after the timer is done. there is no 30 second timer which is already mentioned in some of the reviews/Q&As. So, that is a fact..just confirming here.
