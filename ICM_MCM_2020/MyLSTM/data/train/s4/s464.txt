I have both straight and curly hair (blow dryer + round brush, straight. A little curl spray & diffuser, curly), so I've owned tons of blow dryers. This diffuser is great. I diffuse with my hair upside-down & it gives me big full curls. Others have said their long hair has gotten stuck in it & that hasn't been  the case for me. Only reason I gave it 4 stars & not 5 is because it's larger & heavier than I expected.
