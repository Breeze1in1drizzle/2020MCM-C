I purchased these planning on not using them until late summer after I had established breastfeeding with my son.  However, he arrived 5 weeks early and with a very weak sucking reflex, so we have used these to help teach him how to suck.  The hospital had the soothie type pacifiers, but my son never figured out that he was supposed to suck on it.  It seemed too stiff for his weak suck reflex. Compared to the MAM pacifiers we used with my older son, I like the design of these much better.  They seem to fit better in my son's mouth, especially being much smaller.<br /><br />We initially used them right before I would breastfeed him to get him practice sucking and then quickly transfer him to the breast.  In addition, we have used them for very brief periods of time (like diaper changes or baths) when he gets very upset, as he tends to gulp air and then spit up more.<br /><br />Since my son was premature and is just now breastfeeding well, we are slowly using these less and less, but will likely reintroduce them when he is a little older.<br /><br />My only complaint so far is that I had no idea what colors we would be receiving.  I was actually hoping for more gender neutral and we ended up with bright primary colors that would have worked for a boy or a girl, but some color selections would be nice.  I really appreciate that these don't have gendered pictures or sayings on them.
