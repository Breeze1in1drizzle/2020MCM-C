Our son loses his pacifier in the night and thought this was a good solution that he might be able to grab this instead of waking us up.  He does find it and play with it in the night, he just doesn't like the pacifier.  He prefers a different kind.  The times he has tried this the giraffe looks like a nice size to hang on the pacifier, not too big and heavy.  I gave it 4 stars not because he doesn't like it.  I wish the pacifier could come off of the giraffe so you could replace just the pacifier if needed.
