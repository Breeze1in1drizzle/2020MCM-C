I used this hairdryer while on a trip to Ireland.  While it's true that you only get one functioning speed when using the dryer with 240 volts, the speed you have is very powerful.  I stayed at a number of hotels that had dryers available, but in most cases, I used this one instead.  This gave me the convenience of using it anywhere in the room and had more power than those supplied by the hotels.  It is very light weight and compact for packing.  I would definitely recommend this to others who want to be certain they have a functioning hair dryer while in European countries without having to purchase and take the risk of using a convertor.  A plug adapter is still necessary.  A simple turn of a screw using your fingernail changes the dryer from 120-240 volts.
