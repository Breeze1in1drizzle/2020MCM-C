I bought this before realizing that my daughter didn't care for a pacifier. She would keep throwing it on the ground because she didn't want to use it, which made it a little difficult for cleaning because it was attached to a stuffed animal.  I wish she would have liked it because it was a bit expensive. Hoping that my 2nd one likes it! It's very cute.
