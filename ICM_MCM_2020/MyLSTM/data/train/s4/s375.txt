This dryer is soooo powerful and dries hair very quickly, which is the point, i understand.  My only complaint is that its so powerful that the little attachment tools get blown off very easily and i find that very frustrating.  Im learning to dry my hair w/o the benefit of those little diffusers.  Not so bad but for the money they should have them screw on instead of just popping on so that they wouldn't blow away like they do.
