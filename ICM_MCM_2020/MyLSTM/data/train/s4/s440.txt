This dryer is actually and excellent value for what it is being sold for on Amazon (about $28).  The power and heat control is a good as units I have paid over $50 for.  The shape is good and it feels very comfortable in my hand.  I have fairly short hair so I don't need to use the attachments but they come in handy for those with long strands that need to isolate and concentrate the air.  The switches make the heat easy to adjust, making it good for drying a pet (I try to not use heat to dry my dog).  Overall a good unit.
