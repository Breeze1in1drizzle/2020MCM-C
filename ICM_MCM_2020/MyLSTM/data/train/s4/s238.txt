In my rush to get ready for work in the morning, it is nice to have this extra strong dryer to blow on my balding head after my shower for 90 seconds in the early morning light and make it appear that I actually have more hairs than I do. I like the ability to choose a cool as well as a hot air setting. The filter unhinges from the back for easy cleaning.
