The tip of the pacifier is completely rounded as opposed to the slightly curved ones that contour to the inside of the baby's mouth better. I suppose it all comes down to the child's preference... in our case the little one isn't a fan of the strictly cylindrical pacifier nipple so he won't keep this in his mouth for long. Still fun though and can serve as a slight distraction.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very cute, lightweight monkey. Almost worth it just for the stuffed animal<br />Sturdy pacifier with no rubbery taste, holds up to biters<br /><br />Cons:<br />The monkey is only attached to one end of the pacifier, which makes me worry that it will rip off if the little one decides to pull too hard. Every time I pick it up I think &#34;I hope this doesn't rip off as easily as it feels like it could...&#34;
