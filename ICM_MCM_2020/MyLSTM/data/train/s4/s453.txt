This is a nice looking hair dryer that works fast. My hair usually frizzes out when I blow dry it, but not with this. My hair did not feel dried out at all after using this. The blow dryer has hot, warm and cool settings with a cool blast button. The back opens easily, so that any dust buildup can be removed. The weight is a bit heavy, but the design makes it nice to hold. I took off one star because the diffuser did not do a great job on my wimpy curls, but the other attachments worked out well for me. The color is nice, but if it came in green, that would be even better. The best blow dryer I have used so far.
