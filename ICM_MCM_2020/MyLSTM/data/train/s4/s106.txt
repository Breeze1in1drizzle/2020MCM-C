This is a good hair dryer for the money - quick drying time but it's a bit heavy and kind of loud.  I bought it for travel but because of the weight, I wouldn't recommend it for that.  Home use is fine and it's compact because of the retractable cord and folding handle.  I have another Andis dryer and believe Andis makes a good product.
