I like the look and functionality of this microwave and it is at a good price compared to others. My only negative feedback is that I feel it is a little loud when turned on (my husband thinks I only hate this because I don't like loud noises) and it doesn't heat things as fast as our old microwave. For this one, if the recommended cooking time is 3-5 minutes I will have to put it in for about 3:30, where on our old one I could put it in for 2:45.     Overall, though, it is a good product at a good price and has good functionality.
