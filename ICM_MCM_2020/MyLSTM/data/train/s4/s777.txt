My son loves these pacifiers. The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the cleaning/ sanitizing issue they have.<br />The first pacifiers we got we had to throw after we washed them with hot soupy water- the soup went inside the pacifiers and there is no way to get it out.<br />Second set of pacifiers we throw after we sanitized them. The steam went into the pacifiers and when my son start sucking on the pacifier, it was making  noise.<br />My advise is - just wash the dirty pacifier with warm water.<br />I will definitely recommend these pacifiers!!! My son loooovess them. I had tried almost all different brands on him, he likes only these.
