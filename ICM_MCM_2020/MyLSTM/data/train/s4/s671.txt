Our baby has used these since birth...he is 15 mos old and still in love with his paci.  They are soft and flexible in his mouth easy to attach to most paci holders, and are nearly the same shape and texture as a standard narrow neck latex bottle nipple making the use of an occasional bottle easy for this mostly bf baby.  There is a hard plastic peice inside the paci used to keep its curved shape that I wish wasn't there because if you accidentally smash the paci under foot or some other way it will break and poke through the silicone making it unusable.  Otherwise it would be very durable.  Baby now has eight teeth and hasn't bit through a paci yet.
