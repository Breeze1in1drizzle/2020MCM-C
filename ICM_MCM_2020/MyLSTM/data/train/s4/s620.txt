This is a very versatile microwave. The basic functions of a microwave - heating, reheating, defrosting - all are performed excellently. But this unit does so much more - it comes with stacking parts that allow you to heat or reheat two plates simultaneously, which is extremely convenient. Best of all, it is a convection microwave, so you can pretty much do everything you would need with this microwave - bake a cake, broil, etc. You can cook fried items in a manner that limits oiliness. I like the pull down door, rather than the open out variety - that function saves space, actually. Decently sized - a little smaller than my previous microwave, but as much size as you could need. Stainless steel is great - matches the rest of my kitchen - and its a high-ended looking device. Very solid, well built, good value for money and does everything it promises.
