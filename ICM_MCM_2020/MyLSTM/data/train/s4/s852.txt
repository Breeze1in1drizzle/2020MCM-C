I love the Wubbanub! I would give it five stars, except that they are not kidding when they recommend replacing them every six months. We purchased the newest one on November 30th and, just yesterday, my 14-month-old bit the end right off! Thankfully, I caught the piece out of her mouth before it became a choking hazard! She adores them, though -- won't sleep without one!<br /><br />I always said I was going to hold off on introducing the pacifier, but the hospital nurse gave her a Soothie pacifier when she was first born and it soothed her so much right away. I was glad to see that Soothie pacifiers are the ones Wubbanubs come with because it's the only type of pacifier she prefers. During those first few months, the Wubbanub definitely saved us from a lot of screaming!<br /><br />What's not to love? They're cute. You can find the pacifier when your baby hides it in the blankets or whips it on the floor. Half the time when it falls, the pacifier itself never even touches the ground. They clean up easy with a bit of dish soap or in the laundry machine.<br /><br />I buy them for all my girlfriends' baby showers.
