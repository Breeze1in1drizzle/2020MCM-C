My sons favorite pacifier - but not my first choice.<br />Both of my kids have decided that these pacifiers were their favorite. However, the issue that I have with them is that it isn't all one piece. What ends up happening is dirt, soap, water, etc. is able to get into the pacifier. I'm usually able to clean them out for a while but eventually, they end up needing replaced.<br />I wish that my kiddos would have picked a pacifier that was all one piece of plastic so that I could clean them easier - oh well!
