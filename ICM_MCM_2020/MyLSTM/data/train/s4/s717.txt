This pacifier is great for when your baby is in the carseat or crib because it offers the stuffed animal to hold onto which is nice. The only down side is the fact that the pacifier is sewn onto the animal and cannot be removed. This makes it difficult to clean and really the only thing you can do is rinse off the pacifier being careful not to get the stuffed animal wet. You could put it in the laundry but this seems like too much work everytime the paci needs to be washed. Overall, nice product although a bit pricey.
