Overall a good product.  Has a powerful motor in a very compact form.  No problems installing holder and have had no problems with unit.  There are only 2 settings, 1 low and no heat, and 1 high with heat.  However, my wife says the heat setting is not that warm so factor that in.  If you want real heat, this may not be unit for you.
