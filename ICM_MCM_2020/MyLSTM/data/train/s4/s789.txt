As a newborn, my daughter (breastfeeding) did not take to this pacifier (we were warned of nippple confusion, etc, but this wasn't/isn't a problem for our kiddo). For her first month, she took to the MOM brand pacifier for newborns. However, after about a month, she took to it very well and loves it now. She is 3 months and still breastfeeds very well and takes this pacifier too.
