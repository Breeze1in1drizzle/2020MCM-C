This is the first time I've purchased a hair dryer on line.  It seems that I've had to replace my store purchased dryers annually if not sooner in the past.  I'm hoping this one is better built than the others I've owned previously.  It does seem to be a higher quality product.       I have to confess that the color of this hair dryer was what initially caught my eye.  It's a powerful dryer....certainly has shorten my hair drying time.      I like this product a lot with one exception - - the position of the buttons.  They are situated at the middle of the handle.  I end up accidentally shutting off the dryer constantly in the midst of drying my hair!  Not a big deal - - just sort of irritating.  Had they moved the buttons higher up on the handle, this problem could have been eliminated. Perhaps they'll make that adjustment on the next model.    Nonetheless, I think this product earns a 4 star!
