We purchased ours from a local store in on order to have it installed. They DON'T install the charcoal filter! GRrrr.... The reason I was so disappointed is because I'd read it was a bugger to install, as it was the wrong size. I was appalled to be told that they never install the filters, even if purchased from that store (bought mine on Amazon for $30 cheaper than the chain!). Was told I have to take the front panel off!!  IF the directions are followed carefully, it's very simple. It is designed to tilt, not stand straight inside the vent opening, as one would think. I tell YOU all this to say, laugh at the installation guys, get a screwdriver, and tilt the filter in, and pat yourself on the back. Who needs them anyway? Oh, yeah...to lift and drill and screw the thing in. It's heavy! Now, as for performance, more to come later!<br /><br />One last thing, all the reading I did on this led me to believe the vent was a powered door that opened, and that is a part that often breaks on OTR microwaves. This does NOT have a powered vent door, it just recirculates. That was the only reason I purchased a warranty. Oh well, now YOU know!
