I love the glow in the dark feature but unfortunately my 7 month old baby does not like the 6 months + nipple shape which is very different from the 2+ months shape. I found some MAM glow in the dark pacifiers in the 2+ month version at a local store and she likes those. I can finally find her paci in the middle of the night when they otherwise get lost in the dark. When she is crying in the dark instead of feeling all around the crib searching for them it sure is handy to have the soft glow to help out. For those reviews that say they don't glow in the dark, you actually need to charge them up first by exposing them to bright light for a few seconds and then they are good for the night.
