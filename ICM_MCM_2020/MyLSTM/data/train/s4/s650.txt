My one year son still uses his pacifier from time to time and it has been very helpful.  However, since turning one he has been using it less and less and playing with it more.  He has intentionally folded the pacifier and put the entire thing in his mouth causing him to gag.  So it is definitely possible for the pacifier to fit into a childs mouth.  Be very careful if your child starts bending and folding the pacifier it could become a choking hazard.  Until then it is a great pacifier and your child will love it.
