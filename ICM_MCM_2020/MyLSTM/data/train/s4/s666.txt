I breastfed for two years and let my child self wean. This was the only one that was accepted (about 5 styles tried). I did find the funk in the seams issue to be a bit gross. I soaked it in pure vinegar to freshen and disinfect  and scrubbed it with a toothbrush which worked great.  However, when I realized that the rim had BPA in it (Mine were from 2008) I switched to the Goldi Natursutten which was an easy switch.  It has the same shape and comes in different sizes. It is all natural rubber and a wonderful product.  Their teething rings are great too.[[ASIN:B001AVPLRA Natursutten All-Natural Rubber Rounded Pacifier, 6-12 months]]
