This model was installed by our contractor and served well for several years, until one day its innards flew apart (nobody was hurt) -- so we bought a replacement.  The wall mount is very convenient.  Because we installed it low on a cabinet and the cord is a bit short, we hung it upside-down (i.e. cord on top), which requires the fifth (optional) screw through the hole in the magnet (otherwise it would slip right off the wall mount).  Power is adequate for me.
