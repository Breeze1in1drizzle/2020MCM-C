After reading the good to excellent reviews I purchased the dryer recently.  The delivery was speedy and all the parts were included.  My adult son, who's good at assembling things, put it together for me.  I'm African-American with long Locs that I roll-up on curlers and my hair dried evenly at a comfortable setting.  I had to place thick cushions on my folding chair, which is somewhat low,  to sit high enough for my head to be covered under the dryer.  I wasn't able to adjust the height locking knob to lower the hood.  I'll have to call on my son again.  I love the convenience of giving my hair a deep heat conditioning, rinsing, rolling it on rollers, then drying it with my own professional bonnet style hood dryer.  My curls were soft and springy.  I've only used it once and so far so good for the price, timer and range of heat settings, size of the hood, ease of use, and aesthetics.
