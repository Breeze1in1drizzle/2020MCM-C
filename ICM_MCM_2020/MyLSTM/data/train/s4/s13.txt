This hair dryer really can't be beaten for the price. It gets the job done and also comes with a diffuser and a concentrator.<br /><br />The barrel is very wide, moves plenty of air, and is one of the quietest hair dryers I've used, but also definitely does not have that strong of a fan. I don't mind this usually, but sometimes if my bangs are acting up I'd really like a large amount of air/heat to put them in place. Usually the concentrator is fine for this but it'd be nice to have a bit more flow.<br /><br />The diffuser is also very nice. I've never really used a diffuser until getting this but it generally keeps my thick, curly hair frizz free as long as I don't dry it completely. If I dry it 100%, then I definitely get some frizz on the top layer of my hair.<br /><br />Overall, very happy with this product for the price.
