Bought it early for my son to get used to it by Halloween. Hes not really a pacifier-user and started chewing the teeth and handle first. Today he just discovered the teat/nipple. So far so good. Since I think its main purpose is for the onlookers to be pleased and to just have fun with it, Mommy's very pleased.
