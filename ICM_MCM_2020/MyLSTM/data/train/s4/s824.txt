I have tried other brands with him, but my son prefers these.  The glow feature is pretty handy when they get dropped at night.  Although once the glow wears off, it is very difficult to find a clearish pacifier even in low light.<br /><br />It is important to keep these clean.  I found what I think is mold growing under the cap.  It is impossible to get under the cap.  If you squeeze the nipple in sort of a pumping fashion, you can get water into the cap area, but not enough to clean it out properly.<br /><br />Since these are what my son likes, I will buy them again, but I will be more diligent about keeping them clean.<br /><br />At the time of this review, Amazon's price is kind of nutty.  They retail for less pretty much everywhere, even at another Amazon owned site.  I'll be picking up more at a brick and mortar.
