I could have sworn I put new batteries in it and then a week later I had to replace the batteries again.  Other than that it works okay, it's pretty easy to understand but it does look like a cheap toy when you open it.  Am I sure it is working???  I don't know, I assume it is.  My advice is get it if you really think you need it, otherwise you can skip it.
