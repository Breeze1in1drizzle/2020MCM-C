I have very thin fine hair and only use a hair dryer for spot drying on occasion. I had a great little travel dryer that worked great for years until it recently just died on me. In looking for a new dryer I found most were too big and bulky for me, as well as too powerful for my hair. This dryer had the lowest wattage I could find. While it's still a bit too powerful for me, it serves my purpose, as it is small and lightweight. The only improvement I would have made would have been to have a foldable handle.
