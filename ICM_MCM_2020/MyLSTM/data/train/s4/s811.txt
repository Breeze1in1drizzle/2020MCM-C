Fair warning: you never know which model of soother your child will like.<br /><br />For us, our son loved the Avent soothers and no longer uses the more &#34;orthodontically correct&#34; models.<br /><br />A few notes:<br />--a single-piece (can't break causing a choking hazard)<br />--dead simple to clean<br />--symmetric design makes it easier to put in the kids mouth<br />--through-hold tells you if the kid is actually biting down (and hence whether or not it's just going to fall back out).
