I like having this gizmo. It takes two pushes to get the process to begin. When the light goes on, you just close the top and wait. I wish there was a way to show that the germs are actually gone. I just trust that it does what it is supposed to do. It takes up a bit of space in the diaper bag, (about 2 fists worth) but I do have room for it. It looks spacy. I wish it were made to close and throw it in the bag to let it work. I have to set it on a table or so while it is working. Mine has been around for about a year not w/o it breaking. I am glad to have it. It definately gets attention and people think I am a cool mom in the know about all of the latest baby gizmos. Ha! Now if only there were a gizmo to get my toddler to stop taking my infant's pacifier in the first place. Then, I would hardly need this.
