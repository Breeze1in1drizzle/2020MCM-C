I understand there are instructions you can enter to turn the beep off, but then I'd probably forget food is in there.  When the food is done it IMMEDIATELY starts an obnoxious beep and continues to do so with 20 second breaks.  If the beeping started TWO MINUTES after something was cooked I'd be okay with it since most instructions say to let food sit for two minutes after cooking.  We have to take food out right away to stop the beeping, or open the door and let it sit with the light on.  Just a poor design in that way.  Seems to cook normally and looks good.  Still running okay after about 18 months.  I came on here thinking if prices had dropped I'd buy a spare (I figure they all die after 5-10 years and they are a pain to match in looks) but after reading the reviews will save my money til I really need one and buy something else.
