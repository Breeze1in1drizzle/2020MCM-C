I actually LOVE this hair dryer and would give it 5 starts but due to where the on/off button is (right where my thumb warps around the handle) I keep accidentally shutting off the unit while I am using it--so for me there is a tiny design flaw. The dryers works quickly and leaves my hair shining and healthy.
