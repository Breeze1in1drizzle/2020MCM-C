These are nice pacifiers.  They come with a nice plastic container that you can add water and throw in the microwave to sanitize the pacifiers which is nice.  However, they're tricky to get in with the correct side up - you have to look at the image on the front of the pacifier to determine which side needs to be facing up... that's kind of annoying if your baby spits the pacifier out frequently.
