You can actually repair a Sharp Microwave that stops turning<br /><br />You'll be fooled at first because usually to fix some appliance, you remove the cover, or case, or housing, or whatever you call it --- the Cabinet.  Don't.  In fact, on a Sharp Microwave, they used some screws to hold on the cabinet that you don't have the wrench for.  It's like saying, &#34;These arent' the screws you're looking for.&#34;  (You don't need to see his identification papers,)<br /><br />The arcane baffling steps that aren't explained anywhere and that you haven't experienced before --<br />1. The little perforated plate near the center of the back, after you turn it upside down, is removed by ripping it away manfully.  Never done that before on ANYTHING.  No screws,  just hack at it.  You'll be thinking, &#34;But if I bend it and twist it, how will it go back on? &#34;  Well, first of all, you can dispense with it; but if you feel like it, you can flatten it and then turn it over and you'll see how it has little tabs on it to reinstall it.<br /><br />Actually , once you get that little perforated plate off there, it's trivially simple.<br /><br />Carry on.
