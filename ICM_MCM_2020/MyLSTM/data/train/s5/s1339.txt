This hair dryer is fantastic! I have thick curly, long hair (almost all the way down my back) and it takes about 4-6 hours to air dry my hair. I hate hair dryers though because they make my hair brittle and dry. This one does not do that -- in fact, y hair looks shinier.<br /><br />It's very easy to operate.
