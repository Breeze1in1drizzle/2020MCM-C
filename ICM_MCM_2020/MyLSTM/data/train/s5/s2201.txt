We purchased two of these while our twin daughters were still in the NICU and we love them! They are now 4 months old and we have yet to use or purchase any other pacifiers. Easy to clean off with hot water and/or a mesh laundry bag. They are the perfect weight, not too heavy, but just enough to keep them in place. Really soft and cute in person too!
