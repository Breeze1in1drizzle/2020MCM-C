I bought this hair dryer at Target several years ago, and was SOOO impressed with the power, that I would randomly talk to people about my new hair dryer!!  I had long hair at the time, and it cut drying time down significantly.  Also left my waivy hair perfectly straight and silky smooth.<br /><br />I do think after a few years, the Ion starts to lose effectiveness (on all hair dryers I've ever had).  I had it for at least 4 years, before the back filter broke, and then my hair started getting sucked into the back.<br /><br />So I tried several different dryers, even expensive name brand ones like Babyliss, none that I really LOVED like this one.  I recently chopped my hair off, and am using a less powerful dryer.  But after realizing my love for this dryer, I went ahead and bought a second one, and have it put up in my closet, to use again once my hair grows back out, and I need that 'power' to straighten and dry quickly<br /><br />Only CON is that is IS a bit heavy... after having no luck with lighter ones, I realize the weight is worth it.
