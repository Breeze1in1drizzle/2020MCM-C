This is for all you Dog Bathers. I wanted a dryer that would  match  some of the over-priced professional pet dryers.  This is perfect. It  blows very fast or slow. It's also very lightweight. On cool and warm it's not  too hot.  And it's very quiet compared to  all of the dryers I've ever used. So if you're looking for a dryer for your dog or cat, you won't be  disappointed. And if you happen to  need it for you're own hair it's just fine.
