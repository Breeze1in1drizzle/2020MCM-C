1. You can't beat the price...EXCELLENT!<br /><br />2. Easy to use.<br /><br />3. Doesn't take up much space.  I've even packed it in my suitcase and it travels well.<br /><br />4. Great for warming food & bottles.<br /><br />Suggestions:<br /><br />1. Only use distilled water in it...works much better.<br /><br />2. For cleaning: Once a month use a mixture of half distilled water & white vinegar (about 2 oz. total) pour it in the warmer and turn it on.  Doesn't smell great, but works FANTASTICALLY!!!<br /><br />LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!<br /><br />P.S.  I've been using this product for 6+ months now.
