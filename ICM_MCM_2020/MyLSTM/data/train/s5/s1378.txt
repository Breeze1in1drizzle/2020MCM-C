This midsize but powerful dryer is a game changer. I LOVE it! I have layered, waist length hair that becomes a frizz mess if not blow dried properly. The Volare V2 dries my hair smooth and silky. I've been using Sedu 6000 which blows too strong and gets really hot surges that smokes my hair. V2 has the perfect combination of heat and airflow, and the cool temp actually blows cool air. My hair dries and styles faster with the V2 than the Sedu. Made in Italy. Four year warranty. My search for the perfect dryer is over.
