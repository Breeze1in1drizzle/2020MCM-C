Pacifiers!  A baby's best friend!  (Not all babies...my daughter couldn't stand them.)  Like food, clothes, and cars, binkies (aka pacifiers) are a very personal item for a baby.  I know some parents buy a binky only to have their little one spit it out at them.  They then buy another one and the baby loves it!<br /><br />These particular binkies aren't heavy and are geared toward newborns and up.  They're pretty small for little mouths so sucking shouldn't be an issue.  Parents can hold the pinkie in to help the baby get used to it.<br /><br />Fortunately, they're BPA-free and can be washed in the dishwasher.  Personally, I would rather wash it by hand like I did with bottles.<br /><br />Will your baby like these?  It's hard to tell.  Babies are very picky about their binkies.  The only thing you can do is buy the set and try them out.  Amazon doesn't charge too much so testing them out won't break you.  Hopefully your baby will like them and, if he/she does, get more of them!<br /><br />Did I mention the colors?  I like that they are in the &#34;neutral zone&#34; so they can be used for boys and girls.
