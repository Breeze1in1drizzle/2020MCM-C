I bought this for a trip to Italy and it worked great for me.  It's very small but also very powerful.  I have a lot of thick curly hair so a need a good hairdryer.  I also bought the diffuser attachment.  I actually think it's better than the hairdryer I use at home!  You will need an adaptor but it has a voltage converter so it works much better than hairdryers that don't have a voltage converter.  Worth the extra bucks.
