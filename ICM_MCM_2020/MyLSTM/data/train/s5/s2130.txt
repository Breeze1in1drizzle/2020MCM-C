We bought the giraffe Wubbanub for our newest addition, our 3rd baby girl. I cannot say enough great things about the Wubbanub. She loves it! It has become such a comfort for her and I can tell her and her giraffe will be great friends. She loves trying to grab and snuggle it and I love that I don't have to keep putting a pacifier back in her mouth all the time. Thank you Wubbanub for making a product that is great for every mom :)
