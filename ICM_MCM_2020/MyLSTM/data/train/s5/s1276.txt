I was finally ready to replace my 8-year old travel hairdryer  with something more powerful and quite, and yet just as light-weight. I have fine shoulder length hair with a tendency towards frizz.. I stumbled across the positive reviews for the Onei MKII while researching several other hairdryers (T3 featherweight, Elchim 2001 and BaBlyiss 2800). I chose the Onei based upon the great reviews, the 4-year warranty, and the price. I think this hairdryer is great. It is very quite, dries my hair in half the time, and feels like it will last. My hair feels great - not scorched like with my old dryer. If you are looking for a top-performing dryer, I would highly recommend trying this dryer first! The cool setting actually gets very cold, which is also  a great bonus for locking in curl and reducing frizz.
