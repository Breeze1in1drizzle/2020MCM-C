I have very long thick hair that is chemically straightened and high lighted. Usually I go through 2-3 hair dryers a year and never get my hair completely dry.... Until this dryer. It is AMAZING!!! Normally it takes 30-45 minutes for it to be somewhat dry -but not with this dryer. My hair was COMPLETELY dry in 15 minutes. Save yourself time and money and buy this dryer. My only regret is not buying it sooner! Great price and will definitely buy another to have as a spare.
