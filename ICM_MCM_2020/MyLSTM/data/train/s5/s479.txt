My favorite blow dryer finally died, so I was forced to buy a new one. I am so glad I did. This blow dryer dries my super thick, long hair way faster than any other blow dryer. And I think it looks shinier and straighter too. The pink color is pretty, and makes it easy to find in my pile of hair instruments. The retractable cord is so nice, it doesn't get tangled in with my 3 curling irons and flat iron. (I wish they had the retractable cord too!). And the cord doesn't retract too fast and hit you in the hand. Great, salon-quality blow dryer for a fraction of the cost.
