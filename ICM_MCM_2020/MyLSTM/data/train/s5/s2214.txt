These pacifiers are wonderful when you need one in the middle of the night! I was pleasantly surprised by their quick charging ability and also their ability to hold a charge for a long period of time. My son loves his MAM pacifiers and these make locating them in a dark nursery or crib much easier when trying to get a fussy baby back to sleep!
