I received some Mam pacifiers as a baby shower gift.  They were 6m+ so when he was 6 months I washed them up and tried one.  He had been liking the Avent pacifiers so I didn't expect him to like these large, oddly shaped pacifiers- but he loved them!  I wasn't even sure what brand they were, so I asked around, and my day care provider knew it was a Mam.  I ordered more and he they are his faves!  He prefers over Avent and Nuk.  I read reviews and many other reviewers said their babies really liked these when they were teething.  Mine is definitely teething.  I'm not sure if that is why he likes them, or if its something else, but I swear by them now.
