My wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old. We feed our daughter with bottles (mix formula with breast milk), and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref (my wife did breast bumping), and mix with formula, we use this warmer all the time. Also, when we travel out, this one is quite useful. Generally with only a little small amount of water, the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby. Also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag (well, not compact bag though).
