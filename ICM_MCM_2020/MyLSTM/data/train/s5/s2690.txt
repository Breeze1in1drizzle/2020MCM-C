my 17 month old daughter loves this pacifier.  she is old enough now to visually recognize this passifier vs the other 10 in her crib.  she prefers this one.  i think (i am guessing here) that it is because the plastic is thicker and more rubbery for chewing on than her other ones.  i don't know, but she loves it.
