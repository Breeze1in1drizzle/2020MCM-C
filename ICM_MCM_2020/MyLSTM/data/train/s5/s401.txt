All I can say about this hair dryer is that my wife loves it. I purchased the very same one around 5 years ago. Well, it finally died, but since it was so good, I purchased another one for my wife. She says that it works faster than others she had before, that is comfortable to hold and obviously it last for a very long time. She highly recommend it!
