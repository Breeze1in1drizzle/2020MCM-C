I love this product! I try to use natural things for my baby and this pacifier is perfect. I'm pregnant with my second child and plan on using again. I recommend using this pacifier above all other natural rubber pacifiers. I have tried the natursutten ones and do not like them at all!! The way the little handle is it jus collects fuzz and dirt that you cannot get off! Absolutely horrible! So I recommend this product above all others.. And I think my daughter would agree! She loves it too! :) hope this helps!
