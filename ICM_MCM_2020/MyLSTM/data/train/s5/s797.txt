Great hairdryer!  Used one for several days in a hotel in Canada and liked it so much I ordered it when I got home.  Sort of rubberized handle makes it non-slip, has 2 speeds for both heat and air flow, very lightweight so my arm does not get as tired, not as loud as so many others are, does a great job.
