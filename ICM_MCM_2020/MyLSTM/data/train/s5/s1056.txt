My sister in law is hairdresser and bought me one for my 35th bday. After 10 years of using it every day it finally quit. I have very long and thick hair and this is the best hair dryer since it dries my hair quickly. I went online to Amazon to buy a new one and am thrilled. Would never go back to cheap dryer that hardly works again. You have to go Turbo!! You'll be very happy you did.
