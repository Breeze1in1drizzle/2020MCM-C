It's everything the other 4-5 star reviewers said. My favorite part is the soft sound and the long cord.  And of course Amazons service is one of the best!!! Love Amazon!!    Update;  8 months after purchasing this dryer, I pressed the cold shot button and it would not pop back out! I was unable to send it back to Amazon for an exchange but they told me to contact the manufacturer and that it was still on warranty! I did and Onei Beauty made it simple! I send it back to them and they'll send me another! Voila! Done! I'm not sure how long this product will last, but feel confident that the company will take good care of me should it happen again within a reasonable time frame! Because after all I REALLY LOVE THIS DRYER!!
