The hospital I have my children at uses these.  It seems that once they are hooked, this is it!  The only problem is they are not readily available to purchase like the bigger brand names.  They also have no place to put the clip that prevents the child from losing it.  My son loves these, however, I can't seem to have enough of them because he drops them, they bounce (oh, yes, they are rubber you know) and they get lost!!!!
