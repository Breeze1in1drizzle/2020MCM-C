Very convenient for newborns who aren't able to hold the pacifier in themselves. My daughter has Down Syndrome, which tends to be associated with low muscle tone, making it a little more challenging to maintain her hold on the pacifiers. This was really helpful in keeping the pacifier in for her, which also led to her muscle tone improving thanks to basically working out her muscles by sucking on the pacifier. It was very handy in the NICU, by holding the pacifier in for her when someone wasn't able to physically pop it back in her mouth. It's also been convenient in her car seat, when I am not able to help hold her pacifier for her.
