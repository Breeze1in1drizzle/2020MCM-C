These are the pacifiers that my hospital gave us for our daughter. As a new mom I was TOO careless with them. They were lost within two weeks and I quickly learned that my recklessness was going to come at a cost. These are the ONLY soothies that my daughter would use. We tried others and she would just spit them right back out. I made it a point to purchase a pack of these immediately in store and then order these ones as a back up. It's that critical to have spares. Do not mess around.<br />I found that these soothies work great whether your are breast or bottle feeding. We did both and I found that it helped her transition between nipples well. No latch confusion. It also helps to be able to insert your finger into the hole if your baby is teething so they can alternate between sucking on the soothie and clamping down for their gums.<br />Also, these things are SO easy to sterilize. And I've never had an issue with them ripping.<br /><br />If only I could get my second to use them!
