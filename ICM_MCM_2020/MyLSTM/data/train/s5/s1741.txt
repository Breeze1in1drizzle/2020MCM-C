Once my newborn reaches a deep sleep, I place him in his pack n' play with this bear in the corner with the volume on low.  This bear works great for keeping him asleep and the sound isn't nearly as obnoxious as some of the lullaby music that we have to listen to on his swing.  I would definitely recommend this because it's super cute (baby's first teddy) and it works for my baby!
