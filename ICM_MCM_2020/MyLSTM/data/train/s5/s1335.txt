This hair dryer has been amazing. I have very curly hair that is sensitive to heat and I found that this hair dryer does not dry my hair out. I am a sceptic at heart and have been disappointed by many dryers but I have to confess than after a few months of use it has improved my hair. I do find that my curls are less frizzy and do not tend to dry out as much thoughtout the day. I have never found drying my hair an enjoyable experience until now. This dryer is not cheap but not the most expensive either and well worth the price. I will be buying the flat iron in the future!
