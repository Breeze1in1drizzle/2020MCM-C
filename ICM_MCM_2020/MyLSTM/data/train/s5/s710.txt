1. I was very happy with the smaller size and lighter weight of this dryer. It doesn't get heavy while using.<br />2. I really appreciate the easy reach of the temperature buttons, cool shot and on and off buttons.<br />3. It also dries hair more quickly than other dryers.<br />4. It has a nice look to it.<br />5. Lastly, this dryer is easy on the hair too.It leaves hair feeling soft and looking glossy.<br />I love it and recommend it highly.
