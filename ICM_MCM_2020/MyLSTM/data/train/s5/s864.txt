I have 3B curly hair and the diffuser attachment works amazing, it doesn't make my hair frizzy but provides a lift to my roots. The dryer is super lightweight and is very quite. I keep it on low and the power is still amazing, it cut my hair routine by half. I would highly recommend this to anyone with 3B curly hair.
