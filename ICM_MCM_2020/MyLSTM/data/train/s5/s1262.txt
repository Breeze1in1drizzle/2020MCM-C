It was such a pity to receive this and plug it in only to find that it didn't work. The lights came on and the unit got hot but the air didn't blow. I was looking forward to using this as the reviews from others was outstanding. Had to return it and didn't replace it.<br /><br />REVISED: December 1, 2015<br />This new review is LONG overdue.<br />NOT ALL HAIR DRYERS ARE CREATED EQUAL! I never knew there was such a difference a hair dryer could make on the styling of hair.  After I had returned the DOA hair dryer, Onei Beauty contacted me wanting me to be happy with my purchase and offered to replace the unit. Just the customer service was golden to me until I realized their product was equally as golden.<br /><br />After I received the replacement I immediately had to wash and style my hair. I can't believe how shiny and soft my hair felt. It's so easy to style my hair now. And it's quiet AND light.  If you're on the fence in purchasing this hair dryer, do not hesitate, buy it. I can't thank you enough, Onei, for making me so happy. Sorry it took so long to tell you how much you are appreciated.
