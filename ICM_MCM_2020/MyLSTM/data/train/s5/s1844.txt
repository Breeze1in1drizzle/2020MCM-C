I love these so much that I even sent some to my friend back home in the UK because she thought the big American Soothie pacifiers looked ridiculous, and couldn't believe they would make one that would cover a baby's nose. Anyway, I think they are wonderful. Exact same nipple shape as the Soothie, but with room to breathe! My son doesn't have a problem with them either. I particularly like that, with this particular nipple shape, he doesn't really hold onto it for too long, and just sucks until he's pacified then spits it out. I don't foresee pacifier addiction in our future. Can't recommend it highly enough, and this is the best price around!
