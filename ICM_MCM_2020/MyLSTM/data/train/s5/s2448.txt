My seven month old loves this toy.  I thought it looked silly, but bought it anyways.  Well worth the purchase.  We attach it to his car seat handle so it dangles in his face.  He loves grabbing the pacifier and putting it in his mouth.  Even when he has other toys and pacifiers in the car seat with him, this is his &#34;go to&#34; toy/pacifier.  You put in your favorite pacifiers, and can change them out when he goes up a size.
