My baby will not accept any pacifier other than this brand.  We have them strewn about our house and cars.  As other reviewers have noted, it's pretty cute to watch that little &#34;o&#34; through the transparent nipple.  Tip for weaning them off of it when you finally need to: poke a hole in the tip---it's no longer as satisfying for them and they give it up themselves!
