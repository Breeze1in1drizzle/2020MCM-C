This little hair dryer is great! I had one just like it in the past. It lasted 20 years. It fits perfectly in my suit case, has just the right amount of power and heat. It is much better than others I have used (they did not last long). It is well constructed too. A good purchase. I had looked every where for a replacement and had to settle for inferior products. I am really happy Amazon had it. I highly recommend.
