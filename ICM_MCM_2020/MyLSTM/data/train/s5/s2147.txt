When my baby was about a month old, I got her this because she loves to spit her binky out constantly. I figured with it being &#34;weighted&#34; that it would help some. It did. And it was so cute to see her snuggled up to him, even out of her mouth. (Him because my husband named him 'Geoffrey' like the Toys'R'Us giraffe). We don't use it as much now that she's almost 4 months old.
