The dryer is quiet and calm running, the bonnet is is just the right fit with or without rollers . it has a nice handsome look.  It is sturdy and strong.<br /><br />Great temper control the timer has a slight ticking sound, and the bell rings when time is up awesome, coasters are convent and easily moves where you want it.  Perfect for a home beauty aid. Would recommend to all looking for a home style salon look.
