With three teenage girls in the house, the hair dryer gets a lot of use. A LOT OF USE. We've blown through quite a few hairdryers - no pun intended. This one however, seems to be the clear winner. As a stylishly bald man, I can't personally vouch for it, but the female testimonials are unanimous... this is an excellent product.<br /><br />Full disclosure: the dog isn't a big fan, but she doesn't like baths much either, so can'r be surprised.
