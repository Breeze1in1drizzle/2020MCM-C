Everyone should have these pacifiers!  They are perfect for babies who don't quite have a strong sucking grip and when they fall, they are easier to find (no rolling under the sofa!).  Throw in washing machine then rinse any soap residue off pacifier.  Very durable.  When my son was 1 year, I cut the paci off the mouth of the monkey and handed it to him when he went to bed...He started to put it in his mouth then realized the pacifier was gone then he just squeezed the monkey and laid down!  No more paci after that day and no issues!
