For this baby, these have been the best pacifiers! The nipple stays in her mouth and they are nice feeling. I recommend getting at least two! Every baby is different, so pacifiers are trial and error, but we are loving these. Baby loves that she can take it in and out herself, and chew on the mouthguard for her teeth, too.
