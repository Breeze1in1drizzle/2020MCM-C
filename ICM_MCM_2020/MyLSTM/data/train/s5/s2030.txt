My 9 month old sleeps with one Wubbanub in her mouth, and one in each hand. I keep a stash of them in my car so I can easily pop a new one back over to her when she chucks it out of her carseat. The monkey is my favorite because it's dark colored - makes it easy for her to see it on her white bed sheet in the middle of the night so she can pop it back in.
