I like this product. As someone who regards his hair as stuff that sits on top of my head and needs to be kept in some semblance of tidiness, a grooming product is of little interest to me. I rarely use a hair dryer when I am away from home and it's very much a matter of if it's there I'll use it; if it isn't, then that's what a towel is for.<br /><br />The Mangroomer is a pleasant surprise. The bright red and black design is appealing -- clean, bold and well-shaped. It looks good and feels good. I liked the solid construction and the firmness of the controls. Most of the features go way beyond my needs. I still don't know what all the ionization stuff means; all I want to do is dry my hair quickly and have it feel good. The Mangroomer meets my basic needs in this regard.<br /><br />The slightly higher than average price doesn't seem to me to be excessive and the design makes it worth a few extra dollars. It is definitely more attractive than all the standard bathroom beige and blandness. I did not expect to actually enjoy a hair dryer. Summary: function good enough, quality high enough; design a nice extra
