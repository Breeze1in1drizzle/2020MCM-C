This dryer BY FAR IS THE BEST EVER!!!! I have really long hair extensions and they take FOREVER to dry, and after reading the reviews for this dryer I decided to try it because they say drying in half the time.<br />They weren't kidding, this dryer is AMAZING to say the least, I have never owned such a great product that is so inexpensive; so do yourself a favor, purchase this dryer, you wont be sorry, it is truly the best! Even on cool or medium speed this thing is magnificent! Some of the reviews comment on this dryer being heavy, I'll share a secret...cheap dryers are superlight weight, but in all sincerity, this dryer is not heavy at all, so not sure why some reviews say this. The button placement was an issue when I read the reviews but decided to try it for myself, and what I personally found was, where I place my hand is at the bottom anyways, so it was a non issue for me. It's totally worth trying because everyone is going to hold their dryer in a different spot anyways, and if I didn't purchase this based on what others said about weight and button placement, I would have missed out on the BEST DRYER EVER, and believe me, I have tried them all. And side note, it really does dry in half the time, which means an extra 20 mins in the morning hitting the snooze button ; )
