My son is really attached to his pacifier - these were great. I transitioned him to these from the gumdrop ones they gave us at the hospital. He's outgrowing these now at 4 months, but he is learning to manipulate his pacifier on his own so we give him these to play with. Much better for him to smash the soft rubbery ones into his face than the hard plastic Mam pacifiers he uses now!
