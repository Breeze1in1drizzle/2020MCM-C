I am weaning my 10-month-old and these are the only bottles she will accept. They are easy for her to hold as the bottom is larger and textured (which prevents her hands from sliding down). The nipple has a tapered shape and soft texture, which has has really helped with the transition. Not to mention EASY to clean- wide enough to wash by hand. We have had success with warming the bottle and replacing one feeding at a time. Also using the slowest flow nipple that comes with this set. After a week she is now holding the bottle herself and drinking it happily! There's been no issues switching between bottles during the day and breast at night!<br /><br />As a sidenote, the mam pacifiers are amazing as well. The texture is soft like skin, not slick like other pacifiers. They were my first daughters favorite, and MY favorite because other kinds blocked her nostrils (she was tiny).
