My old hair dryer died a rather spectacular death with sparks and smoke.  I hadn't researched hair dryers before, and I only wanted something that would dry my hair.  So I randomly picked a conair from a local store.  I used it a few times and was not happy with the results for the conair.  It turned out to be loud as all get out, and my hair turned out flat.  I felt like I was in a deafening windstorm.  So now I had a criteria for research:  Something that was quiet and didn't blow my hair into a limp state.  That's what lead me to this Remington.  It shipped and got here quickly.  Yes, it smelled a bit funny as all new hair appliances do when first used, but I was impressed.  It was easy to handle.  I liked that I didn't have to keep sliding buttons up and down to change settings like my old hair dryer.  It was relatively quiet as hair dryers go.  The drying process went very quickly.  My hair had plenty of volume with a smooth, soft feeling when all was said and done.  I'm very happy.  No flat hair and my ears aren't ringing.  I highly recommend the Remington hair dryer.
