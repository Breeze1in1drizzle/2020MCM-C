Im bummed to see so many negative reviews for this product. This is the easiest way to take my son's temperature. Its accurate against the other thermometers we use as well. I dont use the medicine pacifier because hes always been good about taking his medicine from the dispenser from his doctor. But seriously, so much hate for a 5 star product.
