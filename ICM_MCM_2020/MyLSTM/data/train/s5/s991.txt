I have had this dryer for 3+ years and it's still going strong. I love the &#34;satin&#34; feel of the dryer, the 3 settings (plus the &#34;cool jet&#34; button), and the diffuser and concentrator are perfect. This dryer has been through the ringer- from airports to duffle bags to being dropped, etc- and it still works like the day I bought it. Super easy to clean out the dust in the filter too, the back just screws off. Would buy again.
