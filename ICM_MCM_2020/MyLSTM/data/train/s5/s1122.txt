... and if you're not careful, she just might steal it.<br /><br />This Mangroomer Hair Dryer for Men dries my shoulder-length hair faster than any other hair dryer I've every tried (less than five minutes) -- and it does it without over-drying my hair.  I didn't need the attachment, so I can't say how well it works, but this beauty of a hair dryer is now in *my* drawer.  Oh sure, my husband can use it whenever he wants, but this is now *mine*!
