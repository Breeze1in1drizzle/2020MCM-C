My baby loved these MAM pacifiers. The glow in the dark function is nice for sleep deprived parents in the middle of the night. We used these during the day too -  I like the subdued colors. Makes it far less garish than some of those huge colorful pacis out there. We did have to start using the larger 6+ month version because these are quite small. Not a one-size-fits-all deal.
