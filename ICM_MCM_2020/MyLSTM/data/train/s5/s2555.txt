We purchased this for two reasons. One being that it makes trying to find the pacifier in the dark or in the car way easier, and two so that our daughter would be able to find it and hold on to it. Product is well made, and well packaged. Item is machine washable (we found this out after it took a swim in the porcelain throne) and very durable. Highly recommended for anyone with little ones who are still using a pacifier.
