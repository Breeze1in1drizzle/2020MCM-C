This natural rubber pacifier is the only one our baby took-- from day one, our little one LOVED this paci.<br /><br />Its healthy, natural rubber which means less worries given how much direct exposure babies have to pacifiers. No nasty chemicals, no scary ingredients.<br /><br />The only negative is the cost-- they are super expensive and they tend to bounce when dropped, which makes them a little hard to find.
