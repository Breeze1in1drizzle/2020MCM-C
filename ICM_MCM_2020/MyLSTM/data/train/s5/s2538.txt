mam is the only bottle I use for my kids. it is amazing for nursing moms.. all my kids transitioned from nursing to bottles and with MAM bottles it seems a smooth one. After my second child i also discovered that you can sterilize the bottles without the annoying bulky microwave sterilizers! you simply take the bottom apart and add some water and then pop it in the microwave for a minute or so... amazing! the only semi-annoying part is that sometimes if you don't put the bottom back properly it leaks... but by the third child, I just wash them in the dishwasher and don't even bother to take it a part (the dishwasher is great since it cleans the bottom very well without any mildew or anything...). My kids also love MAM pacifiers and always look at me if I try to give them a different brand as if &#34;what are you giving me? this is not the one i like!&#34;... great products altogether. BIG FAN!
