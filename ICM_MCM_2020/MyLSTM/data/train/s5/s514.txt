I have pretty frizzy hair, I get it chemically straightened, but still, when I blow dry it, it's frizzy & I need to flat iron it.  I was AMAZED by this hair dryer!  I used the comb attachment & after drying my hair it looked like it had already been flat ironed!!!  It was straight & shiny.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone with curly hair that wants it straight!
