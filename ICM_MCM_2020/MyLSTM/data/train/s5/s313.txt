We have found the Andis to be comperable to the dryers found in the more upscale hotels. The hang up cord is a great feature that helps keep cords organized. The night light gives plenty of light for finding your way around the bathroom at night. Two speeds supply plenty of drying power. Nice design, easy to mount.
