I was looking for a travel hairdryer.  This is the ONLY hairdryer that I could find that had the retractable cord.  That does making packing much nicer along with the folding handle.  The handle just pulls down and pushes back up easily.  No buttons etc.  It does stay in place when using it.  Super duper drying power!<br />Product Dimensions: 4.1 x 8.1 x 6.1 inches ; 1.6 pounds<br />That said it is bigger and heavier than I wanted for travel but getting smaller like I have had in the past (and can't find) didn't work nearly as well.  I am one half star down because the size seems large for travel which would be the point of the design I would think.<br />All in all, its a great dryer and the best I have found for travel and function.
