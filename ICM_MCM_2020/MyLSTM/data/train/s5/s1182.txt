I have very curly, color treated hair that gets too curly and frizzy when dried with a diffuser. This dryer is perfect to dry my hair and do deep conditioning treatments. I usually let my hair air dry, which can take 2 hours! With the dryer, I put it on cool for about 25-30 minutes while I return emails, and I'm good to go! I like the ability to roll it around as well as the temp and timer dials. Shipping was very fast! I've used it about 3 times per week for a couple of weeks, and so far so good!
