The best baby shower gift I ever received.  I bought this as a replacement since we lost ours for a bit ( never hurts to have a backup).  This became our sons beloved toy and comfort pacifier at all times.  We have now weaned him off at a year and a half.  But, we will definitely be purchasing another type of WubbabNub for our new baby.
