Great dryer! Lighter weight and less damaging than my old one. This is being picky, but I wish the switched the positions of the power and heat setting buttons. I hold the dryer in my left hand and the brush in my right (do other righties do this?). My left thumb is closest to the heat setting button (that I never change) and farther away from the on/off switch (which I use between every section of hair. The result? Accidentally switching the hear setting to &#34;blast furnace&#34; and burning my scalp. Conair, one little change, please!
