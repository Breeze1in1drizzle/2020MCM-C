My sister bought this hair dryer a few years ago for $200.  One weekend I spent with her, she let me use it.  We both have super thick hair which takes time to dry (about 30 minutes with a regular hair dryer).  Most time, I go out with my hair still wet because I don't like to take the time to dry it, plus I get overheated.  Well, this dryer worked in half the time (or maybe less).  I don't go out with wet hair anymore because it dries so quickly.  It's light and works great, and now the cost is less than 1/2 what my sister paid.  Totally worth the investment!
