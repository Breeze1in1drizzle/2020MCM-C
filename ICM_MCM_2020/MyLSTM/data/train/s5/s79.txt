got this Conair Wallmount hair dryer about a month ago to replace the one we had for about 15 years that finally blew up. It's the most convenient dryer you can own. Didn't even have to replace the wall mount bracket. New unit was exactly the same as the old. But - gotta say I'm really glad we kept the old unit. The rear filter screen on the new unit fell right off out of the box. The 2 little tabs that snap the screen onto the main housing were like melted smooth and could not be fixed. But the screen on the old unit was an exact match. So - snap-off, snap-on, and viola, back in business. Lucky for us. And Amazon. Or they'd have to pay for an exchange. And we'd be stuck using a clunky, 10 pound albatross dryer for bout a week or so. Amazon's delivery was 1-2 days quicker than I expected. Good price too. Oh, the built in night light is real handy too. Worked great for at least 15 years.
