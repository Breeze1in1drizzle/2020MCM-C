If you need a laugh,you need to purchase this for some little baby. We bought this as a joke for our great-granddaughter and she looks so adorable in it in her mouth. We laughed and laughed. Our baby surely liked this 'binky' because she used it a lot. It was very entertaining to watch the reactions of people when they first saw her with it in her mouth. It is well worth the money just for the laughs. I loved it.
