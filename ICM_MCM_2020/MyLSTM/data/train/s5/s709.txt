The Remington D-2012 is definitely a grade above the $10-$30 hair dryers you see at Target.  Whether or not it is comparable to a CHI, I don't know.  I DO know it is half the price of a CHI, and unlike Farouk (who makes the CHI), Remington will honor the warranty if you buy it on the internet.  The CHI is a solid product so not many people get bitten by the voided warranty when you buy on Amazon, but there's always that chance.<br /><br />The D-2012 has two air speeds and three heat settings.  I use middle heat + low airflow for my short guy hair.  My wife uses high heat + low or high airflow for her long thick hair.  She says it drys so fast that her hair is dry before she has finished styling it.<br /><br />The dryer has a very solid, commercial grade feel to it.  Read this to mean it's heavy compared with basic hair dryers.  I find it to be quieter than my wife's old dryer that claimed to be quiet.<br /><br />All in all this product is a winner if you are looking for a really good solid hair dryer but you don't have the coin for a CHI.  This hair dryer is likely one of the best in the sub $50 category.
