Like other reviewer, my son is not really into using a pacifier. Instead he uses this mostly as a teether, occasionally sucking.  He flips it around using the loop and the edges to teeth. I feel better knowing what it is made of and not finding out later on that it has a plastic product that only later was seen to cause problems. So far it has lasted through two teeth with no wear and tear.
