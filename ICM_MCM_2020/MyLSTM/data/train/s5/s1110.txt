I have a disability so I can only dry hair one handed.I searched all over the net for a hands free dryer holder and this one was exactly what I was looking for.I stick it up on my mirror after showering  but am planning on attaching it to my wall if they ever get more in stock.Please put more in stock!I need another one to take with me on vacation!
