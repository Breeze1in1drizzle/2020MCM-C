I'm a woman of color with healthy hydrated curly textured hair. It is ESSENTIAL that I have a high quality blow dryer to get a nice smooth blowout without frizz and no damage. I didnt expect anything from this $13 dryer, but figured what could it hurt to have something less bulky to travel with to the beach that works internationally. I used it at home a few times and I am IMPRESSED. I've spent HUNDREDS of dollars on T3, CHI Pro, Superstar -- and they all work GREAT. Well, while this isnt  100% comparable, its near 80% comparable. Fantastic quality! This is one of your best bets for a good quality, high heat/non damaging air flow cheap travel blow dryer that doesnt cost a fortune. I will say that my hair frizzed up much easier when I hit the DC humidity than it does when I use my other blow dryers. But still, a small, minor complaint given that it is less than $20, travels well without taking up space, and gets a decent temperature with good air flow.
