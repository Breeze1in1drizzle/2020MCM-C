We bought every binky known to man for my daughter, and she was not having ANY of them. I could tell she wanted one, but just couldn't find the right way to suck on any. By the grace of god, we found one our first daughters binkys mixed it with her baby clothes. She took right to it. We were so happy. It was the gerber soft center pacifier in the big round bulb shape. I looked for 5 months EVERYWHERE for the same binky. No luck. I even called gerber, and the lady lied to me saying they never sold a bigger version of this kind of binky. She said it must have swollen to that size. Please. I have read quite a few blogs about other moms trying to find the same bigger version. Makes me wonder what they are hidding....I was so frustrated and ready to give up. Finaly I came across this site and it looked very similar to hers. After I read 2 reviews saying the same thing about the gerber binkys, I thought it was worth a try. As soon as I gave it to her, she loved it!! YEA!!! I also love the fact that it is one piece and natural. I have read about another mommy who has this for her kids and she says you most certianly can go longer then 4-6 weeks to replace.
