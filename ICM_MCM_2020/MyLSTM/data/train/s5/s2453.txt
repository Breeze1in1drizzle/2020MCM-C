If you are a parent who pacifies their babies with these wonderful devices, you know how difficult it can be to keep track of these darned things. Buy this pack and put them everywhere you go (in the car, various rooms, hiding spots for an emergency). They are the same great quality you expect when you buy them in twos for twice the price in the grocery or department store. So next time your kid throws his pacifier into the mysterious bermuda triangle of pacifier extinction... no sweat... just grab another one. Our son loves to throw everything (including pacifiers) into the trash when we have our backs turned :)
