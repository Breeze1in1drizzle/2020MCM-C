Im a dude first off. At first I thought it was real heavy then I got used to it however this is my first hair dryer as I am growing my hair longer. Ladies beware of the weight however it drys my hair very quickly its about 4 in all the way around right now and takes about 30sec tops completely dry. When you buy it there is multiple settings you just have to play with the two switches that flip up and down. NOT PICTURED IT COMES WITH A FUNNEL AND THE FUNNEL WITH THE COMB ON BOTH SIDES!!!!!!!!<br />Im 1 for 1<br />Take my advice at your own risk.
