This blower dryer is the bomb. It dried my hair super fast there are three heat settings and a cool down setting, very 21st centuary.  Shipping was fast too. I love the compact size it's not too big or too small.  And as far as blow dryers go it's not nosy at all. I can finally blow dry my hair with out disturbing the nieghbors.
