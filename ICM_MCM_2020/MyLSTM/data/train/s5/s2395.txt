I was leery of giving my breastfed baby a pacifier, but at ten weeks I realized it was what would help him relax during the witching hour as an oversupply prevented him from finding comfort at the breast. He loves to stick his thumb in the hole, which is cute and I think will help him wean from it in the future. His thumbs are getting beefier and I think he'll soon prefer that to the pacifier. You definitely need this 6 pack as pacifiers disappear quickly! Also, my baby has had no nipple confusion with these.
