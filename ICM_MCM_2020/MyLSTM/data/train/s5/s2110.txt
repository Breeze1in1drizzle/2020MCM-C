The MAM brand are the best Pacifiers that I have found so far. My daughter used a Pacifier up until she was a year and a half. She tended to chew on them and other brands wouldn't hold up for very long before getting ripped up. These held up and are very durable. Was signed up for Amazon Mom so free shipping and this qualified to earn extra months of prime account.<br /><br />CJB
