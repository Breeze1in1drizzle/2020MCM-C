You can do no wrong with the Billy Bob gag Pacifiers.  I bought one with 2 huge bucked teeth in the front and they were hilarious.  The grillz are for a girl and her father loved it.  The baby will not really use it as a pacifier normal wear and tear but when they approach their lunch or whatever friends, it is going to be a hoot.
