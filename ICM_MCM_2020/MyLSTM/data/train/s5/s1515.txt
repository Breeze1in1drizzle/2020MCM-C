II had the same problem that many people do with the GE Caf&eacute; microwave. The paint was peeling off after a couple of years and GE would not stand behind their product so I bought this paint and masked off the interior's good areas sanded and prepped and cleaned real well and sprayed a couple of coats. Sprayed really nicely, covered well, not easy to run unless you really squirted in one place for too long. Dried quickly, minimum odor, nice sheen looks like new. This was a good fix although I think it's probably temporary because the product problem was endemic to the unit and will probably continue to flake off but I'm hoping that using this bought me a couple more years. The product came quickly and I was very happy. I would only wish that there was a little bit more in the can but for what it's advertised for it's perfect.
