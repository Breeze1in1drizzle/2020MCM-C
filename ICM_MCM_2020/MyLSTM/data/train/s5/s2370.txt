I love this item. It was so easy & quick to use which is a must for any new parent. The built in fill line is very convenient. Everything can be done with one hand from filling water, to putting the cover on, dumping water afterwards, and taking the top off.<br /><br />I also like the paci hanger & it worked with my Soothie pacificiers that have no ring (just slip Soothie hole onto tree arm & it fits). I also like how the pacifiers do not sit in the water but instead hang up to sterilize, avoiding potential for water to seep into nipple & stay). Lastly, the fact that it sterilizes in 60 seconds and is very small & compact for storage is awesome!
