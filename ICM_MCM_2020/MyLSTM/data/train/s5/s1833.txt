old review:  I bought these because my baby likes soothie pacifiers and I thought these were cuter.  As I read the packaging I saw they have a polycarbonate base surrounded by silicone.   BPA is used to make polycarbonate.  The BPA is surrounded by silicone, but if the silicone barrier fails you are giving your baby BPA to suck on.  I did notice the packaging very carefully says pthalate and latex free, but no mention of BPA because it is not BPA free.  Too bad because I do like them better than the soothies, but for me it's just not worth even the potential risk of spending a good part of the day sucking on BPA.  edited to add:  I noticed that they are now listed as BPA free on the website and emailed them.  They sent me back a note that they made a change to the internal guard last year and no longer sell the ones with polycarbonate!  I found that very very reassuring and would now happily use them.   From their email:  Our GumDrop is BPA Free.  We had made a change to the internal guard last year and no longer sell the GumDrop with the polycarbonate guard.  I really respect a company that responds to the concerns of worried moms!
