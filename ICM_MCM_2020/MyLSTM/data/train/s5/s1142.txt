i am a woman of color and i have to say i am very, very impressed with this dryer.  rarely can i just buy a product like this one that actually works on my hair (especially when i have to do it myself and i have a very nice grade of hair).  it get really hot and actually drys the roots and straightens my hair.  i wish i could say that for the numerous curling irons i've bought.  the one &#34;con&#34; i have is that if you are not proficient in drying your own hair with this type of dryer you can get burned and you should take your jewelry off. i suggest you get some kind of attachment to put on the dryer to assist in drying your hair.
