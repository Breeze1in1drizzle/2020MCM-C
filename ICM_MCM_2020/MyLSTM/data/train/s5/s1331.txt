I am not one to buy an expensive hair dryer, but this Panasonic with Nanoe technology is worth every penny.  The quality is self-evident when you open the package and pull out this professional sized hairdryer.  Although it looks like it would weigh a lot, it is surprisingly light and easy to handle. The controls are simple on the handle, with one side of the switch for temperature, cool, warm, and hot.  The other switch is for high or low air flow, yielding 6 possible combinations.  The Nanoe comes with three nozzles, which slip onto the front of the dryer.  The Set Nozzle for precise styling, the Quick-dry nozzle for drying hair quickly and the Diffuser for creating full bodied hair with volume and styling.  The is also a Cool Shot button on the handle to temporarily turn of the heat, to allow time to style.  The dryer comes with a heavy duty 9 foot cord with a safety overheating/reset plug.<br /><br />The Panasonic has Nanoe technology, which takes moisture from the air and your hair and puts moisture rich particles, small enough to penetrate your hair shafts.  That's quite a mouthful.  What it did for my hair was make it soft and silky, and I can see nuances in the color which I didn't notice before.  The blonde is blonder, the brown is richer.  My hair dried quickly and quietly, none of the loud buzzing in my ear.  As I run my fingers through my hair, there is none of that dry, frizzy, overblown feeling with my lower priced dryers.<br /><br />For results like this, you need to make an appointment at a salon.  If this is in your budget, highly recommended.
