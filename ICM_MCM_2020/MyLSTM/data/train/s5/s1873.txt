With our first baby we barely ever used our Wubbanub, and I wondered what all the fuss was about. But by the time our second came along, I knew how to work it into the swaddle properly to hold it in place. Now I've discovered I can't live without it. After our dog ate our last one, I went a couple hours trying to use an ordinary paci, and I just can't go back. Totally worth every penny.<br /><br />Also, why would you not buy the dragon one?
