This sterilizer is a little pricey, but I'd say it is worth it if you can afford it. I sterilize my baby's bottles daily and I love how easy it is. The best part is that it offers a drying feature. It is easy to operate and clean as well. The sterilization cycle sometimes takes longer than 8 minutes (my maximum has been almost 16 minutes so far), which to me is alright. The bottles come out clean, dry, and ready to use.
