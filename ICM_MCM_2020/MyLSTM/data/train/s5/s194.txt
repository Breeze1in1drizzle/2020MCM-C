I have a lot of hair and have owned a lot of hairdryers in my life.  I would have never guessed that owning a professional hair dryer could make such a difference. This thing is amazing.  It's works so much faster than any other dryer I have ever owned.  I originally started thinking about paying the big bucks for a pro dryer after reading an article on Jezebel. I had this thing on my wish list for a few months, not quite sure I wanted to spend so much for hairdryer.  I ended up buying it for myself as a birthday present -- what a great decision.<br /><br />If you have long, thick, coarse or difficult to manage hair, seriously consider stepping up to a professional dryer.
