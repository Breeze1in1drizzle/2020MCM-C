I originally used this dryer last year at a 5 star hotel in Chicago and loved it. So I asked the desk clerk if I could purchase a new one from the hotel. YES!  My daughter and I seem to want to use it at the same time, so I ordered another one so we wouldn't have to fight over it in the mornings. :-) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because it is small, has great blowing power, has appropriate heat, folds in half, and has a retractable cord!
