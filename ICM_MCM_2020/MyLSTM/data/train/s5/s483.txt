I've used Conair dryers for years, but they share the same issue with other brands......the little mesh screen filter in the back gets easily clogged with dust, lint, and hair....causing the unit to overheat and eventually die.  I've tried everything to keep that little screen clean, including carefully brushing it with a small stiff brush....but then the particulates fall into the motor causing more problems or the lint and stuff just plain won't come off the filter.<br /><br />I just received this new dryer, to replace a Conair model from several years ago.  Conair FINALLY hired someone with some common sense!  I was surprised.....this unit has a REMOVABLE screen filter!  Which means I can take it off and WASH it (being very careful to insure it's totally dry before replacing on the unit, of course), extending the life of my unit.<br /><br />Big selling point in my opinion....removable filter info should be in the description.  Bravo, Conair, well done!
