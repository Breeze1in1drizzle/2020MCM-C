I have purchased two of these blow dryers, one for myself and the other as a gift. The HSI works well, dries hair quickly, the controls are easy to use and the cord is longer than any other I have purchased. I have noticed that my hair is smoother than when dried with my last dryer, a Babyliss Pro. Both of us are happy with the HSI. I would purchase again.
