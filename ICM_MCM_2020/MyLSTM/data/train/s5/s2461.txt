Got this for my newborn niece - yes, I know she's a girl, but it's still funny... just makes a sleeping baby cuter and one that's fussy for hours a bit more bearable.  She doesn't seem to mind.  When she becomes a teenager and I have bribe pictures, well, her outlook might change then...  But for now, very cute  =)
