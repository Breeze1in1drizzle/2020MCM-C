I read other reviews that said this herstyler pro tourmaline hair dryer was very heavy, one even called it a brick. I don't find it to be very heavy. It did have a strong plastic kind of smell, but it has faded away. I think it was just it being brand new. I also found this price to be amazing compare to retail. Have noticed my hair being more healthy. I stopped using this 4-IN-1 oil stuff because it over does it. It sure beats my old Revlon blowout hairdryer. It also has made straightening my hair easier since this smooths out my hair.
