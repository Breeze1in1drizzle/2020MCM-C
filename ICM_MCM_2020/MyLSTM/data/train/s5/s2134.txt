Of the eight of these we have, two are the giraffe. We have used these pacifiers since the day we brought my son home and are so happy with them. He was/is a preemie and in the beginning they were the size of his head- didn't stop him from trying to use them. In fact this is the only type of pacifier my son will take. At eight months he decided he was through with co-sleeping and these have been a lifesaver. If he wakes up he can easily find them in his crib and go right back to sleep. He looks so cute when I go to get him in the mornings. Even if he's not sucking on the plug he's hugging his little friend. :) I just bought another and will probably buy more in the future.<br /><br />If ever there was a perfect baby shower gift this would be it. I think every new Mum should be handed one of these, a swaddling blanket and instructions to put this in their baby's mouth then wrap them into the swaddle with the baby. We've had nothing but good nights since we discovered that little trick!
