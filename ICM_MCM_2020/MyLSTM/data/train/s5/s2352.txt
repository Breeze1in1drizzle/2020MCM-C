I tried making my own WubbaNub-type pacifier bear from a little plush toy and a spare pacifier.  My daughter will use it in a pinch, but clearly prefers the brand WubbaNub pink bear.  She loves the bear body is so soft and squishy.  She also likes to play with the soft tag.  I think when she weans off the pacifier, she will want to keep the bear part as a lovey.  This bear makes it so easy to find the pacifier, especially in a car seat.<br /><br />The only thing is that it is a little harder to clean than a traditional pacifier that can be run through a sterilizer or through the dishwasher.  I boil some water, add a few drops of antibacterial essential oil like lavender, and dip the pacifier end in to soak for a few minutes.  To clean the bear part, I occasionally run the entire item through the laundry washer in a delicates bag, and let air dry.
