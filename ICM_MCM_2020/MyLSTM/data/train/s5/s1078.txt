I really like this hair dryer!  I have long, fine hair that tangles easily so I use the low setting.  The high heat really isnt that hot but seems to dry my hair quickly.  The size and weight feels good in my hand.  I love the cold shot!  this is the first dryer that I have owned where cold shot means cold and not just air temp.  It sets my steam rollers in a second which again saves me time!
