The greatest invention of all man-kind, better than sliced bread!  The wubbanub has helped our daughter soothe herself back to sleep and even learn to hold and grab when she was younger.  At night if she wakes up and needs a pacifier she will magically find her wubbanub, turn it around and put it in her mouth.  She started using the wubbanub at 2-3 months and now is 8 months.  I've read many blogs that say you can continue to use after 6 months, but to gauge if nipple is too small for baby.  I also read that the company plans on making another size smoothie for 6+ months! until then we are sticking with these.  Great gifts too!  I have bought 2 and will purchase more!
