I am seriously impressed. Next to laundry, blow drying my hair is my least favorite thing to do.  I was looking for something that would blow dry my hair fast.  I have very fine hair, longer than shoulder length. The first day I used this blow dryer I had it on medium heat and it took 10 minutes. That is how long my old blow dryer took, but my hair looked much healthier than with other blow dryers. The next day I used it, I set it to hot and it took only 5 minutes!  It still looked great, just as healthy!  My hair is always breaking and when I blow dry, normally the damage is very apparent.  With this blow dryer my hair looks smooth and shiny!  I love this blow dryer.  I highly recommended it!!
