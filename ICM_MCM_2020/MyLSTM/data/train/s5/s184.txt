I bought this for my wife because she borrowed one like this while staying with a friend and loved it.  Good power, multiple heat settings, and doesn't have that motor wind that some put out that drive you crazy.  The vent poece on the back is removeable for cleaning out lint that gets trapped in there... this is a great feature and should improve the life expectancy of this hair dryer.
