I travel a lot and this blow dryer folds down to fit nicely in my luggage. It's powerful and drys my hair quickly without &#34;frying&#34; it. I've tried more expensive models (both Andis models and other manufacturers) but I keep coming back to this blow dryer because it simply performs better than all others.
