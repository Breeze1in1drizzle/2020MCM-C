after reading either terrible or &#34;hit and miss&#34; reviews of other small footprint microwaves with &#34;handle doors&#34; rather than &#34;push button&#34; I came across this from Whirlpool..It had GREAT reviews so I tried it for our new granite countertop (didn't want to use up much space)... it is PERFECT!!
