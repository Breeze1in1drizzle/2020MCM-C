Before I ever used this product I thought all hair dryers are the same because they simply just blow air. After used my friend's Panasonic Nano hair dryer, I knew I was wrong. This is so much better than the cheap dryer I bought at supermarket. My hair wasn't at all frizzy with this new hair dryer. I'm in love with this product
