[[VIDEOID:mo20UFHT4C35874]]The John Frieda JF1 Full Volume Hair Dryer is one heck of a hair dryer. It is both powerful and hot and helps to take a few minutes out your morning routine. While it has many of the same features and attachments of other hair dryers it does offer salon style performance.<br /><br />Notes-<br /><br /> - Heats up very quickly<br /> - Long cord - probably 8-10 feet which allows you a little freedom from your outlet<br /> - 3 speeds and three heat settings<br /> - The back screen lifts up so that you can clean the dryer motor<br /> - It is a bit heavy, which is the reason for removing one star<br /> - Nice look to the dryer - it certainly does not look or feel cheap<br /> - Three attachments including a diffuser and two concentrators<br /> - 1875 watts (watch to make sure you do not trip your circuit breaker)<br /><br />Final Verdict - This is a well-built machine that will likely last you for many years. What some of the features are quite common this is still a hair dryer that should be seriously considered by anyone looking to make a purchase.<br /><br />4 1/2 Stars
