My baby loves these pacis. He had trouble keeping the Soothie pacis in his mouth when he was a newborn so we tried these. They were an instant improvement. He is able to keep them in his mouth much more easily and they have good ventilation holes so he hasn't developed any rash. They also come with a little plastic cover which is great for<br />Keeping the pacis clean!...I should also note that this is my first child that has preferred a paci to the thumb, so at first I was nervous that the paci would mess with breastfeeding. After a lot of research we tried the Avent free flow and we haven't had any issues with breastfeeding so far (baby is currently 4 months old). I highly recommend them!
