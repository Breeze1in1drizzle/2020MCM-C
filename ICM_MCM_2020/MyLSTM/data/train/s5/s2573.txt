I have tried every single pacifier in existence over the course of four babies...and the MAM ones are the ONLY type any of my kids will willingly take. Every other one, even ones that are similar in shape, get spat right back out. It's crazy. I have friends who have said the same. I've also had no issues with my breastfed babies and nipple confusion/preference while using this paci, and I like that this brand has lots of cute designs.
