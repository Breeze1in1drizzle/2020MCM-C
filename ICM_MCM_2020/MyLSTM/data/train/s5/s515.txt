I researched many sites and brands before I purchased this hair dryer. I must admit I was initially attracted to the red color but then was impressed with the other attributes. My hair is relatively short and fine. I need a dryer to help give my hair body and this one does it very well. I like the attatchment that can be used as a comb since it can be used with one hand; I recently had elbow surgery so this enables me to dry my hair with one hand. It is heavy enough to feel substantial but light enough that I am comfortable using it in my non-dominant hand.
