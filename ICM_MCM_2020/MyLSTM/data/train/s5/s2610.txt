Holds a tommee tippee pacie plus clip perfectly. I can even squeeze another pacie if I wanted, although that makes it a little tight. Really easy to clean. I wipe it out or toss it in the wash. Also easy to open with one hand. I was looking at the jujube holder and almost bought it instead of this one, but I made the right choice. My daughter was fussing the other day and I was able to hold her in one arm and grab her pacie with the other. One less catastrophe makes a difference! Did I mention it's adorable?
