My infant will only use this pacifier, and I routinely recommend it to parents who have tried other pacifiers and their child doesn't not take to them. I like that the pacifier is all in one piece and that there aren't any hard parts to be uncomfortably places if lost in bed or the car seat. This pacifier does not leave marks on the face, and the cut out makes it so the child's nose isn't covered.    This pacifier is difficult to find in retail stores, but can be ordered in bulk from the supplier. My only complaint about this pacifier is that ordinary pacifier clips do not work with this pacifier.
