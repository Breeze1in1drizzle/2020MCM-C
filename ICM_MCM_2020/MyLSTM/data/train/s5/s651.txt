This hair dryer is worth every penny! I read an article by a top hair stylist who recommended this dryer.  So when my over $100 infrared hair dryer broke after one year, I decided to give this one a try. I'm so glad I did because not only is it light weight, it cut my drying time down, and it helped smooth out my hair. I never knew a dryer could do that, especially when all my other dryers would leave my natural curly hair looking frizzy.
