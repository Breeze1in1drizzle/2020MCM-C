We were concerned to begin with because of a post about weight but found that this was in fact the perfect size for us. It seems to be well built. Our issue with a different brand had been that the cord would break where the cord met the handle and it seems as though this one the cord is a little more protected. We will see how it holds up over time but as of right now I'm very hopeful.
