I replaced a Conair 1600 which was used daily for several years and finally died. I bought this based on the numerous good Amazon reviews and because some have said that the 1850 watt dryers might not work outside the U.S.  Delivery was swift. The dryer feels substantial and well built. It dries more quickly than the old Conair without hair looking like I stuck my finger in a socket. As was mentioned before, this will dry anything short of a wookie very quickly. Highly recommended.  10/19/10: Just received a second Andis 33805 ordered 6 days ago as backup in the event this model 33805 is discontinued. The original has performed flawlessly and continues to feel well built.
