I got tired of cheaper hair dryers burning out on me, so I bought this hair dryer in February 2009 - over 5 years ago.  I use it every day and it's still working great.<br /><br />The switches for off/low/high and low/medium/high heat are on the handle of the hair dryer, and yet luckily I don't accidentally hit the switches when I'm holding it.<br /><br />This isn't lightweight and it takes up room when traveling, but I still insist on bringing this with me on trips.  Very happy I spent the extra money for it because it's saved me money - I don't have to replace a burned out hair dryer every year.
