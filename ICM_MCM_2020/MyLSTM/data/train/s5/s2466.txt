These looked so cute in the pictures and they are just as cute in person!  My first baby loved pacifiers from Day 1 so I figured my second baby would as well.  I bought a few different kinds to try them out but she just doesn't want any of them!  Still, I would recommend these cute pacifiers for anyone whose baby would take one!
