This blow dryer is very powerful.  I thought it would be very nosy because I've never had a home hair dryer that wasn't; however, it was actually pretty quiet for a hair dryer.<br /><br />There are two speeds: medium and fast.  The medium is so powerful I thought it would be enough to dry my thick, long hair, but it doesn't run at its hottest on medium speed.  Turn it up to full blast though and it's as hot as any professional hair dryer my hair dresser uses.<br /><br />It comes with two attachments:  1)the nozzle that directs the air flow in a small space, which is great for styling by running the nozzle down a shaft of hair on a round brush.  This is what I use to make my hair straight.  2) the round diffuser for curly hair.  Scrunch your hair in front of it to diffuse the air flow and keep your locks curly.<br /><br />The on/off switch and the switch to change the temperature are convenient to use while drying.<br /><br />The coolest part is that it's red.
