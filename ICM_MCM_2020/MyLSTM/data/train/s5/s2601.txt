We love this pacifier. It's adorable and the owl is super soft. Our baby is just starting to grab things, and having the stuffed animal helps keep the pacifier in (sort of!) and gives baby something to grab to try to push the paci back into his mouth. (Or grab it out of his mouth, depending on how his arms are flailing...)
