This little lamb is just so precious. I was really hoping my daughter would love her Wubbanub as much as I have seen so many other baby have, but sadly, nope :( but that isn't the companies fault. These are just fantastic. If I had to criticize one thing it would be that they are rather hard to sanitize. I had been wiping it down with pacifier wipes but I like to boil and microwave sanitize my pacifiers and you are not able to do that with this. I tried holding just the pacifier in boiling water but the steam got too hot and I was not able to hold it there long enough to count. Then, dummy me, thought it would be a good idea to prop it up on the side of the pot so that the just the pacifier was in the water and ended up getting char marks on the lamb, don't do that! Otherwise, it is great!
