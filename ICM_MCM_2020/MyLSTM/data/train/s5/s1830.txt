I bought these for my daughter, prior to my granddaughter's arrival.  My daughter said she'd already purchased a NUK pacifier and they were supposed to be good.    After my granddaughter arrived, she refused to take the NUK.  My daughter forgot she had these but Daddy reminded her. She tried them and the baby loves it.  It's the only one she takes.     They also come individually wrapped and are already sterilized.  A plus.    Also, as others have said, it's nice because you can put your finger into the pacifier to help the baby get started or just to feel their little mouth.  You can also see through the pacifier too and watch them.    Definitely recommend them.  My daughter doesn't think Grandma's research of everything is so crazy now.
