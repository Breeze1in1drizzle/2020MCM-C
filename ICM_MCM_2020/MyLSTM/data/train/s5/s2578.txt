When your baby cries in the night and you're trying to quiet her so she doesn't wake your other baby, what do you do when you can't find a g-d binky?? Do yourself a favor and get at least 2 glow binkies. Save yourself the frustration of looking for a normal pacifier in the dark or with a nightlight. These don't glow crazy bright, just bright enough that you can see them if your eyes are already adjusted to the dark. Love them!
