Love love this hair dryer. My first time to own a Turbo Power but should have been buying for years. Live and learn!<br />I have very fine, thin, hair and all my other dryers have been to harsh on my fragile locks with 1875 watts. After researching the best for my hair issues - the lower wattage, 1500,  is perfect and dries my hair beautifully, smooth and shinny. This dryer is also very substantial in motor which is important to me so it will last.
