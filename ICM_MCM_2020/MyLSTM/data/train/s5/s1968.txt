I love these WubbaNubs!!!. Hard to loose and easy to clean! You don't have to put your fingers/hands on the actual pacifier every time you pick it up. Let the little monkey's body handle that part. They are nice and soft as pacifiers, but also great for teething; and not to mention a little &#34;buddy&#34; that has been there right from the very beginning of life. We raised 4 kids and I don't know how many pacifiers we lost and had to run out and buy past midnight. What a lifesaver!  You don't even have to clip it onto the baby's clothing. Those clips are nice, but surely get lost in the laundry!  Wish I had thought of this a long time ago!  For 5 months we began with 2  WubbaNubs and remain with the same 2 !  My biggest problem is which one do you choose??!  So precious!  Highly recommend this product!
