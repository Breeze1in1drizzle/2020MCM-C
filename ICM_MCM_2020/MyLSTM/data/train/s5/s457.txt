This hair dryer is identical to the one used by my stylist - and I paid the exact same price he did. I have some natural wave to my hair and while the dryer doesn't straighten every hair on my head, it does a better job than a regular dryer does. My hair tends to retain water, but I would say drying time is less than five minutes with this dryer (my hair is shoulder length). At my last cut, my stylist remarked that my hair is in good condition  - about a month after I'd been using the dryer. The dryer does get hot, but not to the degree my other dryers have. Granted, I don't have a warranty with it, but I'm very happy with this appliance.
