We have 3 children and this is the first pacifier that has been enjoyed by a baby in our home. Our son chews on all sides of it.  It has a delightful Simpsons look to it when in use. We have had each size gradation and they really do change a lot. I LOVE this one. If he rolls on it at night, it's soft. I really can't say enough good about it.  I love that it's BPA free and all natural rubber.
