We went with the Soothie pacifier because I am breastfeeding and we wanted something that wouldn't cause too much confusion.  My daughter loved this pacifier, so we bought the pink / purple ones to have extras (in the diaper bag, in case one got lost - and they always get lost LOL!).  We never had an issue with it causing troubles with her breastfeeding.  I know several other breastfeeding Moms who use this pacifier too.  My daughter has now found her thumb, so prefers that to a pacifier, but I really liked this pacifier.  Plus it is easy to clean as it is one piece.  We did buy and try the gumdrop pacifiers as they have the same nipple, but are shaped to fit their face - they have a curve to the base and a cutout for the nose.  My Daughter didn't like those as much as her regular soothie.
