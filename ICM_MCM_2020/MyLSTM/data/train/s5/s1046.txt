I am very happy with the dryer so far. It fits in the limited space I have in my salon. I love the way the controls work and I was very surprised how much heat it generates. I am very pleased that it works on a 110 plug as opposed to a 220. I do feel that this is one thing you need to add in the description of this item. I almost did not purchase it because I did not know this piece of information.
