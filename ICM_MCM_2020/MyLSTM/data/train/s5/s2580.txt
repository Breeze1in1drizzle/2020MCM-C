Just purchased this after reading reviews on a Mom FB page.  This pacifier is great!  Slides right into my baby's mouth and doesn't come out as often as the Philips Avent pacifier which I had been previously using (since that pacifier has a little handle). At first I didn't like that it didn't have a handle, but that's one of the reasons why it doesn't fall out.  Very cute prints too.  Also it comes with a sanitizing box which you fill with a little bit of water and sanitize in the microwave!  Genious!!  I will be purchasing a couple more boxes to have extras lying around since we are always losing pacifiers.
