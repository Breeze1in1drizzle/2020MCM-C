We were a little skeptical but this hair dryer does what it claims. First, it's a lot quieter than any other hair dryer we've used. They're all a little noisy but this one is by far the least noisy. It claims to make your hair shinier, too. Maybe, if you use it the right way. We've been using this for over a month now and it's hard to tell but we're inclined to believe the hype. Overall, a superb product so far.
