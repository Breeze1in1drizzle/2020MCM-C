I bought this because the counter footprint and wattage were both low. I didn't expect very intuitive controls, a super easy-to-clean interior, weirdly efficient heating (stuff gets hot FAST) and thoughtful design touches like an interior light that switches off with disuse, and a polite, non-obnoxious &#34;your stuff is done&#34; beep that only goes off a few times before quieting down. It's a great little microwave. Bit tall, but that should be obvious from the pictures.  Update: Died in 2017 after years of faithful service, and I'm going to replace it with the same model. It has a totally unmatched capacity to footprint ratio, and I'm really annoyed that no one else is making microwaves that stack the mechanical bits under or over the food cavity. This is obviously the better way to build a microwave.
