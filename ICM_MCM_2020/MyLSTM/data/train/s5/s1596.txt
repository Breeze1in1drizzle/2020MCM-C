I only use a microwave to reheat coffee so when I bought my new house and it didn't have a microwave in the kitchen I was kind of like, meh, no biggie. However, after several weekends of cold coffee I caved and went looking for a small microwave that would look cute on the kitchen counter without taking up too much space. I AM SO FREAKING HAPPY WITH THIS. It's literally the most adorable microwave that you could ever want. If you do &#34;cooking&#34; with a microwave, then this isn't your best option. But if you're looking for something to heat up a beverage or reheat something small then this guy is great for you. Have I mentioned how cute it is?!
