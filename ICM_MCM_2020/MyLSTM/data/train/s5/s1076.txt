I have never really bought anything online and this is the first review I've ever written. That said, I'm extremely happy with this purchase. I didn't know a hair dryer could *style* my hair. This product is much more powerful than my previous $15 drugstore purchase. That feature helps tame cowlicks! Overall, I have no complaints. I am very happy!!
