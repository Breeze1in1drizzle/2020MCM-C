This dries my hair very well, and doesn't cause any frizz. I have naturally thick, long, curly hair, so whenever I decide to straighten my hair, I need to ensure that it dries halfway straightened (I use a flat-iron after I am done drying). The concentrator does an amazing job straightening my curls while leaving my hair without frizz and fly-away hair (I also use One N' Only argan oil to help control frizz). I use the diffuser whenever I want to dry my curls, and I love the way my hair turns out after a few minutes of drying.<br /><br />This purchase was definitely worth it!
