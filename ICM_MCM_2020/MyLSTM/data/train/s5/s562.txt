My purchase of the Hot Tools Tourmaline Ionic Standing Hair Dryer was a great investment. I love the purple and black color. It has two heat settings, high and low. Two speed settings, high and low, and it has an on/off ionic knob. It has an adjustable pole which is great when you have more than one person using it. It also has wheels so it is easy for me to roll it around the house. This is much better that the hooded dryer that I had to sit on the table and find a chair low enough so I could fit under the hood. I use my dryer on a weekly basis. The hood is very roomy and has a flip up front. I can dry my hair with large rollers with no problem. Now I can get the salon feel of the hair dryer at home.
