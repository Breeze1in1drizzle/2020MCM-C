I've had pixie short hair that dried in 5 minutes for most of my adult life. But since I've decided to grow my hair out, it has taken forever to dry. I wanted a hair dryer that was fool-proof and unintimidating and this product definitely delivered. It has 4 settings: cold, high, low, off which are pretty self-explanatory. Seriously, any newbie can operate this. Now I wake up with perfectly set hair because I'm able to dry and semi-style it in the evening before I go to sleep, with a little argan or sweet almond oil on my scalp as a heat protectant.<br /><br />People have complained that the 'cool' setting is not cool enough, but I actually like that. I don't like using the hot settings too often for fear of ruining my hair, but cold air would be difficult to deal with in cold weather.
