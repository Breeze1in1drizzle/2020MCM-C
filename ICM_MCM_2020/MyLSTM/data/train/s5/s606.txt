I love this dryer.  I used a similar one at Planet Hollywood in Vegas and tracked it down when I got home.  I have wavy hair that always frizzes into a puff ball when I use a hairdryer.  I had switched from my old dryer to the Remington Wet2Straight which I thought was the greatest invention ever, but this dryer quickly replaced it.  The key is the high power motor, it gets my entire head dry in less than 10 minutes, with no frizz.  A quick run through with a straightener after I'm done is all I need.  Plus it's lightweight and quiet.  This product saves me at least 15 minutes in the morning that I used to waste getting frustrated with my hair...try it!
