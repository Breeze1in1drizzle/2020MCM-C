We decided to put up a chimney exhaust in our new kitchen, so a bulky, over the range microwave was out. Plus, we never use it to &#34;cook&#34; from scratch. Why have such a giant wasting space? My dear, handy, wood worker husband built our new cabinets, so it was no problem to create a perfect space under the counter for a new smaller microwave. Love the drop down door. Plus the features are incredible: SlimFry, convection, and grill!! Note: The Samsung is not meant for under the counter, however we were able to provide plenty of air circulation, so it has not been a problem,
