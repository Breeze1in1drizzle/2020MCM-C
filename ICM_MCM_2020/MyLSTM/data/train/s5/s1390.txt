I got this because my old hairdryer was starting to get beat.  I was really surprised at how quickly my hair dried using it.  I have long hair which usually takes a while to dry and literally it took just a few minutes to get it dry.  Really surprising.  And it wasnt superhot either.  I also had more shine, again a surprise.  I dont know how a dryer can shine your hair but it does.  I didnt expect the claims on the box to really be true, particularyl at this dryers price.  A great deal!
