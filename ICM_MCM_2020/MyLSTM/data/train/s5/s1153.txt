I first used this hairdryer at a hotel. It is definitely one of the best hairdryers I have ever owned. It is small and compact, and folds nicely. It also has a retractable cord, which is a huge bonus. As far as drying goes, this dryer did a great job on my hair. I have thick, coarse hair that is about shoulder-length. The airflow is excellent, and this dryer shaved at least five minutes off my normal drying time. It is also surprisingly quiet (as quiet as a hairdryer can be), even on the high speed. I highly recommend.
