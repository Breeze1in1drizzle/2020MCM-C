I love this hair dryer!  It dries my hair in half the time and leaves it feeling very soft and smooth.  I can't believe the great price - I had been looking at it in a local store for $250!!  Glad I didn't spring for that!  It is also much quieter than other hair dryers.  Don't hesitate to buy this - you won't regret it.
