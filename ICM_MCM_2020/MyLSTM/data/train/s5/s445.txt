I absolutely LOVE this hair dryer. I have long and very very thick hair, so I need a powerful dryer (I've tried many of the dryers one could find at the local Rite-Aid or CVS and even after an hour my hair would still not be entirely dry). This one does the job in about 20 minutes and it is also very small and relatively light weight. From what I've looked at, this is the strongest travel-size hair dryer out there and after taking it with me on a 3 state spanning business trip I was very glad with the fact that it was half the size and much stronger than my old Solano (which, for the record, I love, but is just really large and inconvenient to lug around in a suitcase). I also love that the dryer has a loop so that I could hang it on a hook (as my bathroom doesn't have much storage space). I would recommend this to everyone, especially if you need something you can travel with. My next purchase will be the 2400W Babyliss, once I can find it in the US.
