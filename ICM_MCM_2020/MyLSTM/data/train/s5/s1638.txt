This is perfect for one plate! It nice to have a microwave big enough to cook a turkey, but honesty, who ever cooked a turkey in a microwave? This is perfect and the round design means it fits a plate in a very small space! I got one for my mom, too, and she loves it! She finally threw out her old huge microwave and reclaimed counter space! My only wish would be that it was a full 1000 watts (it's 750) just so it would match the cook times on most microwave meals and recipes.
