I bought this for an upcoming trip.  It is super lightweight and easy to use.  It doesn't have a cold shot but I don't need one.  It also doesn't have a folding handle, but it is still super small.  My 2 year old can handle it as it is lighter than her toy one.  It is also perfect for her hair on low.  I do recommend this to anyone especially those with mobility and dexterity issues.  It is super lightweight, super small, about the size of a female's hand spread out, dries almost/ as fast as my Babyliss Toniro full sized dryer.  It is also cheap and comes with a little bag to put it in, though my baby has took it as her own along with the dryer!<br /><br />Edited: It does include a concentrator and a diffuser, though that diffuser is so small.  I don't have curly hair, so I don't' use it.
