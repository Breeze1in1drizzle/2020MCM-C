We have a GE oven/microwave combo (the microwave has the oven controls on it) and the paint was coming off the microwave.  I was concerned it was dangerous so I considered replacing the entire unit.  Then we heard about this paint and thought it was worth a try.  My husband is quite handy so he did the sanding and spraying and the microwave looks brand new.  Couldn't be happier and it sure beat the price of replacing the unit.
