This hair dryer is the best one I have been able to find! I have very long and thick hair. It used to take me about and hour and a half to dry my whole head, this dryer got it dry in...wait for it.... About 25 minutes! Old dryers would leave my hair super frizzy! But this blow dryer left my hair almost board straight. I almost didn't have to use the HSI straightener that I bought along with it. I never used to blow dry my hair because of the time it would take plus how frizzy it would leave my hair but now I have blown dried my hair every single time! Totally worth it!
