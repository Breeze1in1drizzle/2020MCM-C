If I had only known what a difference a hair dryer can make for your hair. I admit that I love to buy beauty products, but especially hair products. My hair is colored/highlighted, fairly straight, but not thin. Lately I keep buying products to take the dry frizz that seems to appear on the ends of my hair. Little did I know that using the Conair Tourmaline Hair Dryer would solve that problem immediately. The dryer has settings for the usual hot/cold/warm settings and high/medium/low...but it's nice to have the controls slide on either side of the device. It's a powerful 1875 watts that dries my hair faster with ions and gives it body plus takes away the dry ends almost 100%. My co-workers noticed my hair looking better too. Ironically, I don't always use a blow dryer because I want healthy hair, but this dryer seems to make my hair look better. For the price and function, I recommended this dryer.
