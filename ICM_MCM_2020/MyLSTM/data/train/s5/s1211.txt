After my blow dreyer of 10 years stared to loose it's &#34;umff&#34; I turned to amazon of course so look through some reviews and came across this blow dreyer, my hair stylist, who is a trusted friend even recommended it, and of course even she couldn't beat the price, it works really well, my hair is much smoother after using this dreyer versus my old one, it was definitely time for an upgrade. The power is great and I didn't find it to be to heavy. I have long fine hair and it dried very quickly so that's nice considering I'm a mom with a 14 mo old who doesn't have to much primp time in the mornings :)  I would definitely recommend this dreyer!
