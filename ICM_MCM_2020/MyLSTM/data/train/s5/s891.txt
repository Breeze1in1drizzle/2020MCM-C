I purchased the black one via Amazon and I am very pleased with the product so far. I've always wanted a simple solution to great hair and this is exactly it. I used to own a Conair from the drug store and this Sedu has changed my perspective on hair dryers. I've always thought that I can never re-produce the kind of blow out that I get from salons but this hair dryer has made it possible. The air is pretty strong and I don't find the hair dryer heat up more than my drug store one. It does take most of the frizz away and my hair stays in a nice curve for the whole day when I use a round brush.<br /><br />To be fair though, this hair dryer more expensive so you would expect the higher quality to match the price tag. Another thing I found is that it's actually kinda heavy for its size. My old one is bigger but actually weight about the same as this one, maybe even less. If you are looking for a feather weight, maybe this is not for you. Other than that, I have no complaints.<br /><br />Loving it so far!
