This is exactly the hair dryer I wanted - light and comfortable enough to grip and operate with one hand while steadying a wet dog in the other.  It produces the perfect temperature to dry doggy fur. And it's got an easy-to-use heat-release button that's very handy if you worry you might be crisping your dog and want a moment of cooler air. I'm sure it would be great for people, too. but I've never tried it so can't comment on that.<br /><br />One bit of advice - the appliance comes with a safety feature on the cord.  Until certain steps are taken, the hair dryer won't work.  Don't try to figure it out on your own, just read the instructions that come in the box.  Once you've followed them, you'll be able to turn on your appliance.  It isn't necessary to do this EVERY time, just the first time, and I'm glad to have the extra safety feature.
