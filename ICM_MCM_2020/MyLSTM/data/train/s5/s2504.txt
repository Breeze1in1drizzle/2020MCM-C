These are the BEST pacifiers.  Solidly made, one-piece molded silicone.  They are not huge and round like the Soothie brand.  Nice shape to fit a baby's mouth perfectly.  Loved the newborn ones and paid extra just to be able to use these orthodontic ones as she got older.  Recommended by many hospitals.  If i have a second child, i will definitely be using this brand again!!
