We love this bottle warmer.  I was a little skeptical about getting a bottle warmer after reading some of the reviews of the other brand names of warmers.  But I decided to go with this one since its reviews were good and I am so glad I did.  I love the automatic shut off function and the beep when it is finished.  Like anything else, you have to use good sense and adjust the amount of water according to how much in the bottle and check the temp before giving it to baby but I have easily learned to estimate the amount of water needed based on the amount in the bottle.  This is definitely something you will want if you are heating bottles !!!
