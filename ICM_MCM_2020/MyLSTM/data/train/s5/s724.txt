i am a hairdresser for 20 years, i've had tried so many different blow-dryers but this works wonders on every hair types,no other blow-dryer make the hair silky and shiny like silver bird,but it will not last long ,like in two months it will brake, every two or three months i buy new one as i did not find a better blow-dryer i will keep buying it..
