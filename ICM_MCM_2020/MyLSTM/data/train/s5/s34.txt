The initial reason for buying this hair dryer was to replace one that had died. My decision was based on price and product name and couldn't give a hoot about the ION feature. After a few weeks of use the woman who cuts my hair remarked that my hair felt smoother and was laying different. Good to know that it wasn't my imagination. Also, I found that the nozzle is a lot cooler than my old Conair dryer. It's so cool in fact that I don't hesitate putting it away immediately after use.
