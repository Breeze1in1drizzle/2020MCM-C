I love this dryer not only is it QUIET, it really does make my hair shiny and silky.  I bought this because I simply needed a dryer and thought if it could do anything else it would just be a bonus.   I have straight hair which tends to be more shiney than layered, I liked how my hair felt-particularly here where it can be extremely humid. I was pleasantly surprised.  Although another reviewer found the weight a problem, it was no heavier than my old dryer. I love it!!!!
