These are good pacifiers.  My baby is iffy about taking a paci.  Sometimes she hates them and sometimes she needs one to help calm her down.  Of the several different brands of pacifiers we bought her, this is the one that tends to soothe her the best and she sucks on the longest.  As a parent, I like that I can just pop it in her mouth in either way...because of the shape of the nipple, there is no correct up or down which makes it easier to return to baby in a hurry after she knocks it out before she can start crying.  I also like the colors... the white pacifier is actually clear, the only part that is white is the middle nub.
