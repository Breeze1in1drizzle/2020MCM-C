I bought 2 FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 w/ Nano Fuzeion.  One was a gift.  I used mine and it's great!  I have dry frizzy hair and it's the first dryer I've ever owned that made my hair straight, soft and shiny with little effort.  My daughter thought I used a straightener. I highly recommend it - it's well worth the cost!
