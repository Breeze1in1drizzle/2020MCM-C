If you've had a child in the NICU, this is likely the pacifier they used in the hospital. We were almost duped by the GumDrop pacifier made by 'The First Years' brand but user reviews pointed us in the right direction. Having the same pacifier has eased the transition from hospital to home and our son continues to like this one.
