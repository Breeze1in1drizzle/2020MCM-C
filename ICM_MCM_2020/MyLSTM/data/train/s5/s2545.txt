We literally tried 7 different kinds of bottles and finally we found this one!! This is the one my daughter actually drank from!! She hated Dr. Browns. Please try this bottle if your child is not feeding well! I LOVE MAM bottles. Oh and make sure it has the vent system like these have. So much easier to clean than Dr. Browns too!! I can say enough how amazing these are!!!! My child finally ate again without choking or gagging.
