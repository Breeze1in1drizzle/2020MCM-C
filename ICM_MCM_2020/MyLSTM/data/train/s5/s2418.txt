I have two babies that started on Nuk brand pacifiers, which worked ok but those have have an asymmetrical design so you can accidentally put it in upside down, those also have a ring that they grab onto and end up pulling out of their mouths.  We have tried a couple others but they did not seem to enjoy them much.  I prefer these because they are symmetrical so when you're fumbling around in the dark half asleep you can get them the pacifier without having to determine which side is up. They have a nub to hold onto with is great because it provides a decent handle to hold onto but the babies don't grab onto them and pull them out so easily.  The glow in the dark feature is great too, makes them easy to locate in the crib at night.
