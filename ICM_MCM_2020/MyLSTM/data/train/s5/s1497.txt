While redoing our kitchen, I discovered this microwave and I love it!  I was concerned about lack of a turntable but after a month of use, I have founds foods to be heated evenly.  The popcorn button works great and I love how easy it is to program things like defrost, melt butter, warm syrup, beverages, etc...  Most of all, I am thrilled to have the microwave off the counter and the drawer style is a must when mounting in a base cabinet.
