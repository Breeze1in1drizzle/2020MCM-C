I thought paying over $10 for a pacifier was ridiculous, but Wubbanubs are worth every penny. They help keep the pacifier in place, and my son loves playing with the stuffed animal portion. I believe it helps with his motor skills. The only downside is that my dog thinks it's his chew toy, ha! That is obviously not a fault of the product, though. Good thing it's easy to wash and dry. :) We also have the giraffe and longhorn wubbanubs. I think the animals with the longer legs (the giraffe and longhorn) stay in place a bit better because their feet are weighted a bit more, but we love all of them.
