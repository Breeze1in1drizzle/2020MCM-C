This toy has saved our car rides with my 6-month old! She would cry and cry, lose her nuk and her toys in her car seat. This offers a great distraction from being away from mom in the back seat. We use the Nuk pacifiers with the handles and they stay in securely. I also used the teether toys which are cute but heavy. I tried to do one teether toy and one nuk but the teether toy made one side too heavy and didn't work well. Either way she likes the teethers on their own. The materials used are soft and the toy itself seems of high quality. The cow design is so cute! My one concern might be that the pulley system have a bit more tension to avoid sliding while my daughter has the pacifier in her mouth. It is hardly a problem but I could see how it might be an issue if you had a younger, less strong baby to pull it down and keep it in her mouth. My pediatrician even thought the toy was a great idea at her last checkup! Baby girl loves this thing I it has really helped cease the screaming in the car. Great little toy and very useful for us!
