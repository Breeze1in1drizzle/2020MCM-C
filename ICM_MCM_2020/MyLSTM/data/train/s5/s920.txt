My old Conair hair dryer finally smoked--it owed me nothing after many years of great service--and I couldn't find anything in the stores that measured up. Found this one online and so far, it's great. I love that it has options. 4 heat settings and 3 speeds with a cold shot feature and independent controls for many drying combinations. It was the only one I found like it. While the speed isn't as fast and the heat isn't quite as hot as the old one, it still does the job well and my hair will probably be happier for it! After returning one that felt awkward and top heavy, I like that this one feels light and balanced. I don't have need for the 2 attachments but they seem good quality. Hoping it lasts as long as it's predecessor!
