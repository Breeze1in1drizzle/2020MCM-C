I came across this while staying at a Best Western. It impressed me there immediately. I love how this little guy packs a big punch in a little package. I wanted something that isn't monstrous and a labor to hold up to use. Also it doesn't take up much wall real estate (a big plus). The night light is a neat feature and won't create a distracting moon glow that will bleed into the bedroom. It also doesn't demand any quirky requirement to place it back in its mount. It easily snaps right back in without any trouble unlike you find with some cordless tool mounts.
