This dryer leaves all the shine and body in fine hair without sacrificing drying time. It's evident now that the previous expensive, super powerful, tourmaline dryer was blowing the body and shine out of the hairstyle. Many bad hair days blamed on aging/change of life that were actually caused by the too powerful dryer.<br />With absolutely no changes to hair drying routine or styling products all hair drying sessions have produced good hair days. A most pleasant surprise to recapture more youthful hair.<br />This dryer is much quieter than the previous one. The brushed finish and brown body/pink accents feel good to the touch and pleasing to the eye.
