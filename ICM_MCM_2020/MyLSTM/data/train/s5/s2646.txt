I was pleasantly surprised when using th nuby nibbler.  I have bought similar products in the past when my other kids were younger and the kids always love them but they were hard to clean. The nibbler is so EASY to clean the way the mesh comes out and the design of the other parts makes it easy to clean throughout the whole thing. Excellent product, and I like the cover for travel.
