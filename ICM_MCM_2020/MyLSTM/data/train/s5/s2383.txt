These are correct size to use for babies under 6 months. Cute colors, BPA free. Our daughter is happy with these. Review after 1 year: These become our daughters only pacifiers. She is more than a year old, and still using the same size. I had to replace them because they seem to disappear, but love that made of one piece of silicon, and easy to clean. Turned out we never had to go up in size. These are the best. Nice color, we tried all of them, and the green is the one that had been loved the most!
