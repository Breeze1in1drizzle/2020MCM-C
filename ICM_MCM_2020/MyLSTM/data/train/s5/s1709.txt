After two brand-new microwaves which became prematurely aged, paint peeling, dysfunctional I decided this must be a game that I had not grokked. When we looked for a microwave we did not look on the basis of price, being believers, you get what you pay for. This machine, and it is a machine made by man work flawslessly, and has a baked enamel, one piece interior which looks like it will outlast all the microwaves in my future. I will watch and report..two months and counting...
