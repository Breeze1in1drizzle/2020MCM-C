I purchased this hair dryer after looking without success for one this small in local stores.  I have only been using it for about two weeks, and it is meeting all of my expectations thus far.  The size and weight are perfect for carrying in my swim bag, taking up much less room that my defunct dryer.  A bonus for me was the low noise level of this appliance.  I anticipated a loud, high pitched scream, due to the compact size, but it operates with quiet efficiency.  I have short hair, and this dryer delivers quick drying at a comfortable sound level with no hassle with easy packability.
