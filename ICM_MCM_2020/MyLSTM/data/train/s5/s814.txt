Hang up wall mounted hair dryer fit right in the spot the old dryer was mounted. Powerful enough... i choice this particular dryer for the little knob that holds the cord up out of the way of countertop clutter.  And the bonus of the Night Lite ,I overlooked in the description online,  is great for nite trips to the potty. Nite lite can be shutoff if needed.  It sits nice and tidy in the room, up and out of the way of countertop.
