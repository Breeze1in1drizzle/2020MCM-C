Love these!! My son chewed through his glow in the dark pacifiers and so I had to throw them away. I did not realize how great the glow in the dark feature is until we had to use a &#34;daytime&#34; binky at night. I just wish Avent wouldn't make some of their pacifiers with a &#34;right way&#34; to go in. But I'm not counting off a star over it because even when upside down my son doesn't seem to notice or mind.
