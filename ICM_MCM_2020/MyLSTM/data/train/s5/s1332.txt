I was definitely skeptical of paying this much for a hair dryer, especially one with a brand that I have never even heard of making hair dryers.  But the reviews were good so I decided I'd give it a try. I had really high expectations and they were definitely met! I LOVE this hair dryer. I have wavy/curly hair and usually when I blow dry it, it gets really frizzy, this blow dryer gets rid of at least 75% of that friziness, if not more. And the diffuser it comes with is amazing! Another plus, is that it is soooo much quieter than any other blow dryer I've ever had!!
