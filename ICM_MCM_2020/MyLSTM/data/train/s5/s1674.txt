Lighter than the GE one it replaced.  Easy, simple to use TouchPad.  Installation was easy and I am not the best when it comes to installation of appliances.  I usually pay someone but the previous reviews indicated it was simple and they were right.  You just need 2 people when you are ready to lift it up and hang it in place.
