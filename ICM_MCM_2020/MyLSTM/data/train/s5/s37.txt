After my $60+ salon brand hair dryer crapped out on me after like 4 months, I decided to just look for a hair dryer with a great price. I did not even realize that it's a conditioning dryer and now my hair never looked better! My old dryer made my hair look dry and unhealthy and I can't believe how much better it looks now. I love it!! It doesn't get super hot but dries my long thick hair fast and fluffy. I've had it for a little over a year now and it is still working great.
