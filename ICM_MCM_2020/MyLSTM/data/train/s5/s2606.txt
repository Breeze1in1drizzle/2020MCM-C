Just received these today and my son (4 months old) LOVES it!! We originally bought the gumdrops pacifier for him, but he kept spitting them out. As soon as I put this one in his mouth he hasn't spit it out yet! He's been just relaxing and sucking on his new pacifier for probably the past ten minutes (which is a miracle). Great buy!
