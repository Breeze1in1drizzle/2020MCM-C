I've using this dryer for 2 months and decided to get one for my sis and my mom too. It's different than the regular dryer cuz it comes w/ multi-functions. You can choose &#34;scalp mode&#34; for sensitive scalp and &#34;skin mode&#34; when applying face mask. Its a bit pricey but the money is all worth it!!
