Bub isn't much into pacifiers it seems.  But he definitely takes this better than the round Natursutten that hits his nose.  I like this one is natural rubber and is made in one piece (not joined) like some other rubber pacifiers.  The hook fits nicely on your finger without slipping when you haven't got anywhere to pop it down straight away.
