I purchased [[ASIN:B004Q6JL04 Joico K-PAK Quadraion Pro-Dryer]] about 8 months ago, and thought it would be the answer to my needs. Well, to be fair it was for about 7 months then it started dying.<br /><br />So, I purchased this one. I really like it! It is a little louder than the Joico one but that doesn't bother me, this one works great. The buttons take a minute to get used to but they aren't a deal breaker. It dries my hair just as fast as the spendy one, makes it shiny, and has multiple heat settings. The cold shot works great as well.<br /><br />Really is a great deal for a quality dryer, I tried the best and had nothing but issues...so I would rate this one the best.<br />I can recommend [[ASIN:B004Q6LVAW Joico K-PAK Quadraion Blowdry Spray, 5.1 fl. oz.]] it works with any dryer :)
