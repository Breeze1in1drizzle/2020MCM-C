I bought this hair dryer as a gift for my daughter. I also own one and so does my other daughter. We absolutely love this hair dryer. It has 3 speed settings (low, med, high), 2 temperature settings (low, high), and a cool button. It is nicely powered with each setting and very nicely made. I've had mine for a few years now and the reel cord still works as well as it did the day I purchased it. If you are considering buying this product I would highly recommend it!!
