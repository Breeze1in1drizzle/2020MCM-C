I'm so excited to write my review for this one. I was doing research about the best hairdryers, because there are millions of them out there.<br />This one is perfect.  I have waist length, thick, wiry and wavy red hair that really enjoys frizzing and making my life unpleasant.  Finding hair products that work for me, is like my life's mission.  This does get hot! I'm not sure what might be wrong with the other reviewer's products, I think mine gets plenty hot.  Hot enough to dry it fast, without burning the mickey out of my scalp, and man does this thing have POWER.<br />And  its quiet for how much fast air it can blow!<br /><br />I love this, it works great on my hair for volume, or diffusing, and even straightening.  Cuts my hair prep time in half.  Recommend!
