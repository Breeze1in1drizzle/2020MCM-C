I have owned one of these for over 5 years and couldn't be more satisfied.  I originally paid $40.00 and thought that was a high price, but after years of faultless performance, I'd pay that price again.  I'm glad I don't have to because now the price has really come down.  This small hairdryer has more air force than all the big clunky ones I've used in the past.  The telephone type cord is rugged and will stretch as far as 10 feet.    Excellant product in every category.
