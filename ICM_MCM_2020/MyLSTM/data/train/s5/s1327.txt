Not sure what features might be missing to make this hair dryer sell at such a low price. It does everything I need it to, plus has two attachments I've never used (pinpointer and curler?) The 'cool' button actually gets cool pretty quick and feels a little cooler than the ambient temp. Doesn't have a 'medium' setting but I don't think that's worth 20 bucks. If you don't like the color blue, well you're outta luck. Guess since it isn't foldable, it may not be good for travel. Whatever, it blow dries my hair at home when I need it to and does a good job at that. Will update review if it spontaneously melts or explodes.    BTW, review is based on the price I paid for it. The price seems to fluctuate a lot so wait until a seller offers it for 10 dollars or less. Otherwise, it's pretty much the same deal as any other blow dryer.
