The pictures/description did not indicate that it can be wall mounted. I mounted it on the wall with screws (I found a wall stud for one screw location) and it is excellent.<br />Don't mount it vertically. You should mount it, with the slot at a 45 degree angle and not perpendicular. This way, your dryer can be rotated around its vertical axis - so that you can easy adjust to your preference of distance from the wall etc..<br /><br />It is unfortunate, that this product is currently unavailable. I hope the seller would notice this review and offer more.. I know I will be installing this in 3 more of my bath rooms, as soon as they become available.
