My wife bought this for our recent Europe trip.  Small, though not tiny like her old one, but plenty of power, folds for packing, dual voltage means no convertor needed for use on 240V/50Hz in Europe (you do need the little plug adaptor, which is not included).  She says sh'll use in place of her old one when we get home.
