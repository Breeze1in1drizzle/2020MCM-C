Our baby is 9 months old and can't live without a pacifier. We were using NUK orthodontic ones but I wasn't sure if it's 100% toxin free. I got these in 6-12 months. The nipple is small, similar size as NUK's 0-6 months ones, and the indent isn't deep enough to give space to the nose, and it has the rubber smell. But our baby doesn't care about any of these. He LOVES it. He's been sucking on it, chewing on the handle and the disk and just doesn't want let go of it. It's not only a paci for him, but also a teether and toy. So no need for me to buy a separate natural rubber teether for him!
