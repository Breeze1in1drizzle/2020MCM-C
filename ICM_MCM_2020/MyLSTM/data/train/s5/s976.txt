I have a lot of hair. It's waist length, and thick. I used a plastic Conair Ion Shine 1875 hair dryer prior to buying this one. I could dry my hair with the Conair in maybe 15-20min. With the Remington, I can dry my hair in 5-10min! As for the less frizz the pearl ceramic plate is supposed to deliver, I think my hair is less frizzier... I have no idea if this is because of that, or because this dryer can sustain heat and air flow well enough to straighten my hair better.<br /><br />The colors are a bit off from the product image. The removable cap on the back of the dryer is a darker shade of pink, while the buttons and the ceramic plate are a lighter pink (but the product image's pink is a lot lighter). The unit itself is a dark maroon or purple-ish sort of color. It's not black. The material is not plastic. It has an interesting finish... smooth but doesn't slide around on a marble countertop like plastic does). The entire hairdryer is a bit heavier than I'm used to, but it's not too much of a big deal as long as you keep your hairdryer steady and you don't swing it about. Since it dries my hair in just a few minutes, the weight really isn't an issue. The cord is a decent length, but I use this at the sink, so I don't need a very long cord.<br /><br />I like the extra heat so I always have my heat set to the third level. The second level is probably better for finer hair. My hair is thick, so I like more heat. The first level is only slightly warm. It's just slightly warmer than the cold shot setting.<br /><br />As for the air speeds... I also like to use the highest setting. The second highest setting is just as fine, but if I'm in a rush, I blast the settings to dry my hair quickly. The air flow is very strong, so with finer hair, you're probably better off at a lower setting here as well. I noticed that other reviews have said they actually keep the hairdryer about 8in from their head to avoid burns. Just to give you a better understanding of my hair, I use the highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in. So much hair, and I like it long.<br /><br />Overall, hairdryer is heavy, but the heat and the air speed is fantastic for anyone with a lot of hair that's thick and long. Saves me time in the morning when getting ready, and my hair isn't as frizzy. Bonus points: After placing my order, I received this unit the next morning. I'm impressed with the Prime shipping speed with this one.highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in.
