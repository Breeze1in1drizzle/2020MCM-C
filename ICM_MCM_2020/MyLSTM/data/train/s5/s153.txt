Even though I just got this week, I used on both my daughters hair to blow out for the first time!!! I bought this because I remembered my former stylist using this tool on my hair years ago!  I saw the price and jumped on it!  It's not fancy but it has four settings from cool to high heat and if you know how to use a blow dryer properly then you should be fine!  Thanks Amazon for having st half the price as Walmart! :). Worked like s charm on my girls and I only used cool and warm heat! ;) they have lots of curly hair!
