My breast-fed, finger-sucking infant has no interest in conventional pacifiers. He likes the Natursutten pacifiers because they're easy to hold and great fun to chew on. He can easily put this pacifier in his own mouth and take it out as he pleases. He doesn't use the pacifier much for sucking, as he still prefers his fingers, but loves to chew on all parts of it. I have found it to be easy to clean and maintain (I oil it with extra virgin olive oil after washing it so that it looks like new). A little pricey but worth it for me.
