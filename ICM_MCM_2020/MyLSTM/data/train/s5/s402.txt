It does the job well, but it is a little heavier than I'd like it to be.  I needed a full size dryer because I have long hair and it gets caught in the air intake of the lighter weight, smaller travel versions.  There are no exposed screws on which my hair can get caught, as there were on other dryers I've tried to use.  I've always used and liked Vidal Sassoon dryers, and this one is no exception.
