it took me a while to find a blow dryer that actually made it easier to do my hair , usually my hair would still be super fluffy and still kind of tangled after blow drying . I have really kinky curls and after using this my hair was almost straight . I only used a flat iron so it would be sleek but this blow dryer really works . it made my hair shiny and straight and it gets really hot which helps a great deal. I totally recommend this blow dryer to anyone especially if you have kinky curly hair like my self .
