Update:  :(  3rd time using it on travel.  Love this little dryer.... fits great in my hand, easy control.... 3/4 finished with a blow dry,  hair soft waves and then......... oh no!!!!  it died.  Not circuit tripped. I pushed the reset, I plugged into other outlets....  I was in denial.  i just shook it and then, headed out to Walmart with my 3/4 blown out hair, with the one section not done in a french braid.  :)  LOL....  alas, back to a big dryer.  I really liked this but only got to use it 3 times.<br />_____<br />Purchased for travel because of it's small size. Also purchased to use with Soft Hood Dryer attachment.  Wow this little dryer is quite powerful.  the switch was a little stiff to turn on at first and if feels a little cheap but Torumaliine ceramic, little power house.  love it.
