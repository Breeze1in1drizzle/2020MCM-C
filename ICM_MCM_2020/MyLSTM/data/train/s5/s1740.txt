Our son was born in Germany, and someone sent us one of these womb bears. I and the entire staff of the newborn nursery were totally shocked when the sound was piped in over the intercom to the newborn nursery and the entire place settled into blissful sleep within about 45 seconds. I always give these as a shower gift since then. It certainly saved our sleep. However, it is important to note they seem to work only for about the first 90 days after birth.
