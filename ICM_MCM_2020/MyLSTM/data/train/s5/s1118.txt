I love the look of this hair dryer, so I guess they knew what they were doing when they marketed it to men. I'm not a frequent hair dryer user, but it's always good to have one around. This one is manly enough that you'll look cool using it, and can leave it laying around without your date thinking you have a live in girlfriend.<br /><br />Did I just say that?<br /><br />And yes, I suppose I should mention, it really does dry your hair. Now can we go back to talking about how cool it looks?
