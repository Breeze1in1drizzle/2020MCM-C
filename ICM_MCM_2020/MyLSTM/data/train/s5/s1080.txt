My first impression of this hair dryer is its heft. It is not overwhelming, of course, but feels significantly more substantial than the usual plastic-laden blowers. It looks substantial too, with no cheap-looking material anywhere.<br /><br />All the normal functions are there. The top button controls hot/warm/cold, while the second button has the high/low/off settings. The electric plug is shock-proof. And a quick cold button is placed directly under the index finger.<br /><br />Once turned on, the motor immediately makes a statement of its superior quality with its calm low-frequency whirl and the strong yet steady airflow. In the long run, this should be what reminds the owner that he/she has gotten his/her money's worth. The air filter in the back of the unit is sturdy and easy to clean. At 1875W, the heat should be able to satisfy anyone.<br /><br />Overall, the quality and design seem more than enough to justify the price. The only remaining question is longevity. But time will tell.
