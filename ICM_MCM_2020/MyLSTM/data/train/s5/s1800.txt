I'm a new mom and I bought these because I heard that they are great for breastfeeding babies (avoiding nipple confusion, promoting good latching with the shape).  They've been wonderful! Can't beat the price, arrived well packaged, no &#34;funny plastic&#34; smell.  Loop is big enough that you can easily pick up one-handed (thank God) but not too big where it constantly hits things.  My 5 week old loves playing with the loop, working on her coordination.<br /><br />***No breastfeeding problems, baby loves them, mommy loves them.  5 stars for me!<br /><br />I don't know why everyone is so concerned with the colors.  It says colors may vary, pink and purple are colors too! I get that it's a gender-normative thing, but seriously who cares if your boy sucks a pink pacifier if he loves it, it costs less than $2 and doesn't cause breastfeeding issues? A good product is a good product.
