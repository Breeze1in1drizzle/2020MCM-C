I was looking for a pacifier case, and this was perfect! Not only is the price great, but it also serves its purpose. It keeps pacifiers clean, and this case is a nice compact size to fit in my bag. It's made of nice quality and sturdy plastic, and I like how securely it snaps close. The loop doesn't seem as sturdy, but I don't use the loop, so it doesn't matter to me. It fits one pacifier no problem. but you can squeeze two in there, depending on the brand.
