I love this hair dryer.  It dries my hair fast, and makes my hair very shiny and straight.  I used to use Revlon hair drier from drug store which is about $15.  Revlon hair dryer usually stops working after one year from purchase and makes my hair very dry and unhealthy.  This Panasonic hair dryer is a little pricy compared to regular dryer you can get from drug store but you get what you pay for.  It's worth it.  The finish of the body prevents your fingerprints to stick even though you have hair cream or hand cream on your hand so you can keep the beautiful appearance of the dryer. I feel my hair has been healthier and shinier with this.  I highly recommend this product.
