My daughters got these as a gift from my sister in law.  When they were born they were all over 5lbs so the girls spent only a few hours in the NICU.  Once they brought them to our room I asked for a pacifier.  The nurses refused so I sent my husband home for these.    Love Love Love them!!!! The girls were able to keep them in their mouth without us having to help.  With triplets this has been a lifesaver. Our morning nurse used to work the NICU and was so impressed that she took one up to show them.     Not only does it sooth them but our friends and family now look at who has the horse, kitty or dog to figure out which triplet they are holding.    Love Them!!!!
