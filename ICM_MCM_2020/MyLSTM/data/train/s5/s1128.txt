I was extremely excited to try out this product and I have to say, I have been impressed with it. I normally set the blow dryer to it's highest and warmest setting, and I am very pleased with the performance of this dryer in that regard. It is extremely powerful, but it doesn't get too hot or overheat if I don't move it constantly, a nice feature that many other dryers I've used don't have. I don't personally use the add-on attachment, so I can't comment on it, but it seems like it would be a useful tool for those who needed that specific form of styling.
