Wife wanted good hair dryer.  I know nothing about them.  I poked around on the internet and read lots of reviews.  People were very positive about this brand and version.  It is a professional grade high quality dryer and she loves it.  She was not familiar with the brand previously.  The only thing to consider (and not a big deal) is that the power cord is longer than a typical home cord as it seems to true that this is used by professionals.  Not a big deal, but so you know it does not have a little curled up cord.
