I was skeptical about purchasing this after reading several of the reviews, however, this blow dryer is AMAZING!  I have VERY thick, course, wavy, shoulder length hair.  With traditional Conair blow-dryers from Walmart, I would spend 10 minutes blow drying my hair and it would be left really dry and frizzy.  I thought that was how all blow dryers would affect my hair.  Wrong.  With this dryer, it now takes me 3-4 minutes to dry my hair and leaves it with a moisturized sheen.  I almost cried the first time I used it.  Yes, if you hold the handle too low you can accidentally press the buttons, however, to modify that I simply hold it higher up and have no problems.  When this one dies, I'm most definitely buying another.....especially at such a great discounted price!
