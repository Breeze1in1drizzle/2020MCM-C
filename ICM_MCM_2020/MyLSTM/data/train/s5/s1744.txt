The Womb Sounds Bear has put my little boy to sleep numerous times. I really think the rhythmic sound it emits helps him relax and think he is in the womb again. Most of the time I put him down when he is sleepy to begin with, but the womb sounds bear has helped him to go back to sleep if he is waking up, having a hard time drifting off, or being generally grumpy. The sound is fairly soothing, you can adjust the volume, and it even has an automatic timer that makes it shut off after 40 minutes! Myself and my husband have both laughed, saying that it has helped US to go to sleep when it is on. Great buy for new moms or for a gift.
