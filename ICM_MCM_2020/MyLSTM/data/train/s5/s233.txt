This is a great hair dryer. I love the retractable cord and the folding handle -- makes it great for travel. The 1875 watts of power dry the wet hair quickly and I don't have any frizz problems. Other hair dryers don't seem to put out as much hot air so I really like this one for the nice blast of heated air. I've not had any problems with the cord and it's lightweight and easy to maneuver.<br />Recommended!
