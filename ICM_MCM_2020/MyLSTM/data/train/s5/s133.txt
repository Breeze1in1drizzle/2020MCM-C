OMG!!! This is the hair dryer for you. It straightens your hair especially if you have very very curly twisted hair, you'll get it pin straight with this dryer. The Hot setting is hot but it doesn't dry out or burn your hair. It is just soooo worth the money. I've had mine since 2008 and it still runs like the first day I bought it. I've taken it traveling with me (yes it is big - i just don't care because I can't live without it) and any of those cheap hotel dryers, burn my hair so much. No matter what, my hair comes out looking awesome from it. Just buy it.. you won't regret it.
