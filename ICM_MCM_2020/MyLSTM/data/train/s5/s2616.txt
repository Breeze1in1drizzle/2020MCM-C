This is the only pacifier my daughter will take (and we tried seven different kinds!). The nipple on this pacifier seems to be a little shorter/smaller than other pacifiers, which I think is part of the reason she prefers it. It seems very sturdy and is made in the USA, which I really appreciate! If you have tried other pacifiers and your child won't take them, it is worth giving Jollypop a try. Important to note-- I cannot find this in any stores near me, so online ordering may be your only option.
