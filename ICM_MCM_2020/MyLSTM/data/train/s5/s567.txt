I've only had this for about a week but I'm pretty impressed so far.  I had my old hairdryer for at least 6 years and it finally crapped out on me - it was just a Revlon that I had gotten from Walmart or somewhere.  I considered spending about $30 more on a nicer dryer, but decided I'd try a Conair first since it was cheaper and my mom has one that I love using when I go home.  So I ordered this guy (which came in two days - gotta love Amazon Prime when you don't have a working hair dryer) and was initially kind of bummed when I opened it.  I know you get what you pay for, but this one is much lighter than the dryer my mom has, so I was worried it wouldn't work as well.  Turns out my fears were unfounded - this guy is powerful and quieter than my old dryer, and the tourmaline ceramic technology, which they tout as leaving your hair shinier with less frizz, totally works!  My hair has been amazing every day.  I also really like how light it is now that I know it works.  I don't know how long this guy will last and I can see the matte casing eventually peeling off like the other reviewer mentioned, but it's functionality is fantastic for the price.  Would definitely recommend this.
