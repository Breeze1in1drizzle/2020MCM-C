We were losing binkies left and right, and they were the best way for my little girl to fall asleep. Cue this reasonably-priced 6-pack of her favorite style! They are very much like the green ones she was given while in the NICU, just a little bit thicker (being the 4+ month version). She doesn't seem to show any favoritism between the green newborn ones and these pink 4+ month-ers.
