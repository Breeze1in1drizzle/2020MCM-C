The lamb design is the cutest Wubbanub (Wubs) available. Great color. So precious. Everyone that has seen it LOVES it. My 2 month girl and I refer to it as her &#34;Lamby&#34;. We've been using the Wub since she was 3 weeks since she spits out all other pacis.<br /><br />As all Wubs go, great clever design. Helps keep the paci in place because the plush toy gives it some weight but not too much. If the baby wants to spit it out, she still can. And once baby is old enough they can hold it and snuggle it while they use the paci part...or not. They are so soft.<br /><br />I'm also hoping that because there is an attached plush, it'll be easier to wean her off pacis when it's time.<br /><br />I wished the paci part was removable for washing and changing. I throw the entire Wub a lingerie bag and wash with a load of baby laundry. But I'm not sure how great that is since some of the baby laundry is quite soiled. So after I hang dry, I wash the paci again in the kitchen sink with hot soapy water before use. Also my girl is starting to prefer the more bulbous orthodontic pacis instead of the newborn Avent Soothie used on the Wubs. She might grow out of the &#34;Lamby&#34; if she no longer likes the shape and texture of the attached paci. I bought a Binkibear (you can change out the paci on that one) in case she wants to change but so far she hasn't.
