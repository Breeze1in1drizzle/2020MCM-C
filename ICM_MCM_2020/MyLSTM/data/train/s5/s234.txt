The reason I bought this hair dryer is because of the retractable cord and the folding handle. The fact that it's a great dryer and ionic was a plus. My only complaint is the cord does not always retract back into the dryer. You have to pull it out and try again. If you're not careful and pull too much it will be stuck out permanently. This happened to me . I tried taking apart the dryer to fix it but ended up throwing the blow dryer away because I couldn't get it back together. I bought another one and now I am more careful.
