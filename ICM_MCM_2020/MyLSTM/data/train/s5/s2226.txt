My baby is not a very big fan of pacifiers, she spits them out almost instantly. We have tried several different brands and types of pacifiers. The Phillips Avent Soothies are the only ones that she wont spit out. We have about 4 of these just in case they drop or get dirty. These pacifiers are advertised as &#34;helps calm and soothe newborns&#34; and I truly believe this, once we give our baby the pacifier she calms down right away. I would definitely recommend these pacifiers if your baby has a problem with all other ones.
