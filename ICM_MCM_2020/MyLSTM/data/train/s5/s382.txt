After purchasing several other dryers, this is the one! My old Conair Baby, that was ancient, bit the dust. The newer versions were a pale comparison, so I started searching. My requirements were: relatively light weight, doesn't sound like a jet engine, larger than usual air blowing surface, long enough cord, a little less than 1800 watts. This is, by far, the nearest thing to my old Conair Baby that I found. I actually went back and ordered another for a spare. I've been using this now for a few months I think, & I love it.
