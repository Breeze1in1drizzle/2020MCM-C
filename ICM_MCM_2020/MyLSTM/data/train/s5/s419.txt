I considered shelling out some serious cash to buy a high end blow-dryer but then I realized that's stupid...and I'm cheap, so I bought this instead and I honestly could not be happier!  I have long hair (like to the middle of my back) and it's pretty thick and this dryer dries my hair in under 10 minutes.  My last dryer took FOR.EV.ER so to avoid getting stared down by my husband and watching the hate build in his eyes because I was taking so long to get ready and thus withholding whatever meal we are trying to go eat from him, I would just not bother drying and curling my hair and instead would just rock my natural fro but with this new dryer I can do my hair and still get out of the house quickly (relatively, anyway).<br /><br />I recommend this dryer highly!  No need to waste your hard earned cash on a high end dryer; this one does the job!
