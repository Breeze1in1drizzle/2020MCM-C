This review is based off one day's use. I got my sterilizer and dryer and immediately opened it. I previously washed about twenty bottles and put them in the sterilizer to use it right away. After four cycles of sterilizing and drying, I'm obsessed! I can't believe it how easy it works and how well it dries. There's nothing I dislike more than leaving wet bottles for days to dry on my counter. I hope this keeps working well as time goes on!
