I bought this hair dryer after having it in my hotel room in Disney! I was using it and was really impressed with the speed at which is dried, the fullness of my hair and also the weight of the machine. Love the retractable cord. My hair is very fine and fly-away, especially in the humid weather. My style held even in the Florida heat. So, I came home and ordered one. Love it!
