This review is for the Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer. The packaging of this product was nicely done and not too wasteful, but adequate enough to get the contents delivered without being broken or damaged. The product was easy to remove from the packaging, and the instructions for use were very straightforward and well written. The temperature controls and blower settings were intuitive, and the balance of heating and air movement seems to be very suitable. Overall, I was very pleased with the quality of this product.
