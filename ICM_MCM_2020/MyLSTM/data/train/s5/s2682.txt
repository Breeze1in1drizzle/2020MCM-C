My son is not a fan of pacifiers, but if he's in the mood he'll use this or his Wubba Nub Nub that uses a Soothies pacifier.  I did not like this at first, because the tip doesn't have a radial symmetry that I was looking for, only a linear symmetry.  I was not able to tell true shape of the tip based on the pictures. I was hoping that it would be more like Soothies, but with a more bulbous tip so that it would stay in his mouth better.  Regardless, it doesn't seem to bother him.<br /><br />My favorite part about this pacifier though, is that when he drops it, it almost always with the mouth-part up.  Or 'butter-side-up' as it were.  The oval part is heavier, perhaps on purpose, so it almost always turns the pacifier 'in-flight' and lands in the ideal position.  Of course, a tether would be even better so that it couldn't be dropped on the floor at all.  But as I mentioned my son isn't a fan of pacifiers, so we don't have one leashed to him 24/7.
