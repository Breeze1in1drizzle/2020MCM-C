Of my four children this is my first that will actually take a pacifier. She loves the Soothie kind so I got this to help her keep it in her mouth. We've had it since she was a couple of weeks old, she is 2 months old now. It is great. It helps her keep it in her mouth and if it pops out she is able to maneuver the giraffe on her own to get it back into her mouth! She loves holding onto the giraffe too. We also got the cat one but it doesn't seem to work as well, I think because it is shorter. I am going to order another giraffe to have as a backup. Also, we had thrush and I needed to boil it. I used clothespins to clip it to the side of the pan so just the pacifier was in the water. It worked fine, just had to watch to make sure it didn't fall and start a fire. Under normal circumstances you don't need to boil pacifiers anyways so it's not an issue. Generally I just throw it into a laundry bag in the washer a couple of times a week.
