Three heat settings, three fan settings, a truly cold &#34;cold shot&#34;, and tons of power. As my hair has been getting longer, I've been  cutting it close for work in the morning and realized it's the dang hairdryer! It took forever for me to dry my hair. I went through 2 dryers from the box store (both returned) and couldn't find 'the one.' I didn't want to spend a gazillion dollars!  So for the price, the Remington Pearl is a miracle. It's the best hairdryer I've ever used and I can get to work on time now!
