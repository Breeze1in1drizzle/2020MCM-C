Since when did you notice how good the hair dryer in your hotel was?  I recently stayed at the Buckhead Ritz-Carlton and the most impressive thing was the hair dryer.  I could not believe how different my hair was--no friz; smooth and silky.  I actually wrote down the name and info about the hair dryer and ordered from Amazon.  The hair dryer is great.  So good that I ordered the flat iron too!  Great find--I now have the Ritz of hair dryers!
