I ordered a spare Wubanub for my 1 yr. old Grand daughter to have when she sleeps over at our house.  This is the only pacifier she uses and only when she goes to sleep.  She quickly finds it in her crib and doesn't need to have 5 pacifiers in there with her.  . It is soothing like a normal pacifier but also soothing in a tactile way.  It goes perfectly with her Lovey which is an Angel Dear Blankie.
