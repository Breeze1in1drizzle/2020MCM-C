These pacifiers are great!  We tried four different kinds for our newborn baby girl and these were the only ones that weren't too big for her little mouth.  As a result she's able to keep them in her mouth for longer (a plus for the parents!).  I am also breastfeeding and we gave these to her her first week home and she's never had a problem with nipple confusion.
