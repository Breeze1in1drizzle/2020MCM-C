The Wubbanub Monkey is great!!! Regular pacifiers fall out when the baby starts sucking on it and starts to pop it up and down in their mouth.  Very frustrating to keep putting back in their mouth especially while you're trying to get them to sleep.<br /><br />With the wubbanub monkey pacifier, you can spread out it's legs so the pacifier stays in her mouth as she pops it in and out.  The head weighs it down just enough to keep it in.  The position of the pacifier sewed into the monkey's mouth is a good angle to help it stay in.  I heard from friends that some of the other animals are not as good as the monkey for the angle.  The monkey is small and light enough that when she's turning her head back and forth (fighting to not go to sleep) and it gets on her face, she can still breathe just fine.<br /><br />I tried the pacifier clip before purchasing the monkey. The clip works well to keep it from dropping on the floor, but doesn't help with keeping it in her mouth.<br /><br />FYI: this does not keep it in her mouth all the time.  At times, she likes to grab it, yank it out, and sometimes toss it.  But it works well most of the time.  I'd buy it again.<br /><br />She's now almost 4 months old and has been able to grab it and get it into her mouth a few times.  She also loves to suck on it's legs and tail now that she's a little older.  So we only need one item to go out instead of a toy and pacifier.<br /><br />Other sleep suggestions:  From birth to about 2 months old, she just wasn't sleeping well at all, she constantly woke herself up when her arms would suddenly move - it startled her.  So with much trial and error, I found the solution to my baby sleeping all night: this swaddle sleepsack (her arms stopped waking her up), her monkey wubbanub pacifier (monkey keeps it in her mouth as she pops it in and out (most of the time), munchkin nursery projector/sound machine turned to heartbeat & projector, mattress at a slight angle (seemed to reduce reflux) = baby sleeping all night 6-10 hrs!!!! PRAISE the LORD for sleep!!!
