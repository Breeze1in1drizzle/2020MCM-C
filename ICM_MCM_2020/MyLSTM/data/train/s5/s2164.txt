he BinkiBear is simple to use. There are three easy steps. You thread the loop through the ring or vent hole of the pacifier. You then open the loop and feed the pacifi<br />er through the loop. Lastly tighten the loop.<br />The things I loved about the Binki Bear are:<br />*easy to use<br />*it was more like a toy then a pacifier (which reduces the addiction to the pacifier)<br />* makes finding the pacifier easy (for both mommy and baby<br />*  weaning is  easier<br />*works with any pacifier (or teething toy)<br />My daughter loves her binki bear.  When I pick it up she grabs it right out of my hands. It's almost impossible to go anywhere with out her bear. I know if my little one loves it so will yours
