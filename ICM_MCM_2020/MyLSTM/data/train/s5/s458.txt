I have never spent this much on a hair dryer before in my life. But one weak moment I ordered it and I am not sorry one single bit. In this case, you DO get what you pay for. It has a lot of drying power but does not blow your hair to the point it frizzes or feels really dried out. First this threw me because I was used to more hot air blowing out but after I finished using it on my hair for the first time, it was amazing. No over blowing, my hair felt softer and in better condition, and for some reason straighter and more styled. No need to hesitate on buying this. I'll never go back to a cheaper hair dryer again.  If you are still trying to justify spending the money, look at it as saving money on extra conditioner for your hair.  This thing is wonderful.
