Love love love love. There aren't enough words to express how much my 18 month old loves her 'puppies' as she calls them. We'e had to be about  6 since she's constantly hiding them or throwing them in the trash (not because she doesn't like them, just because she's only just discovered the trash). it's just a marvelous invention and my daughter goes to sleep immediately as long as she ha a couple of 'puppies' in her crib.<br /><br />We are great believers in pacifiers. (As is, since 2010, the American Association of Pediatricians). I know they're not for everyone, but taking our five year old's away when she was 2 was no problem at all - and some studies have shown they help prevent SIDS. Whatever you think about the pacifier itself, this is just a genius invention which gives my little girl all the comfort she needs to go to sleep soundly. (Thank God!)
