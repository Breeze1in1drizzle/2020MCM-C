If you want to use a pacifier.  We didn't, until a trip to the ER with the third baby.  Baby was screaming and they dipped one of these in sugar water and instantly calmed him.  Needless to say, we grabbed a handful before we left the hospital and love them for quick distraction during a diaper change or to calm him down when he has gas and a full belly so doesn't need any more milk.
