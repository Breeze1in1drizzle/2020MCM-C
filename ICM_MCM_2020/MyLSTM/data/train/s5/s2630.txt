My daughter had no trouble adjusting to the new nipple design debuted by Tommee Tippee. It is more like a bottle, but still considered &#34;orthodontic&#34;. I prefer the Tommee Tippee mouthpiece design like this because it is more breathable, and less irritating to her skin. It also has the handle which allows her to hold onto them better when she takes them out of her mouth. My daughter sleeps with a nightlight, so I haven't paid much attention to the glow-in-the-dark feature, but the celestial designs are very pretty & good for a boy or girl.
