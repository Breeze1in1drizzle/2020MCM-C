I'm not a professional but have naturally wavy hair which is prone to frizz and fly-away action.  This hair dryer is amazing.  It is heat controlled and not air controlled.  Instead of blowing my hair to dry it out, it gently blows heat at target area and dries hair faster, without wildness and frizz. My hair feels soft, is shiny and dries evenly.  It was worth the money and the time to wait for it to arrive.  But with Prime you'll get it pretty quick!
