As all the other reviews have said, the footprint of this microwave is fantastic. I can't believe other companies have not copied the shape of this microwave. I now have so much more room on my counter.<br />The only quirk that takes a little getting used to is not having number keys to punch in the time. The start button adds thirty seconds every time it's hit or you can add the + key to get a more accurate time. I always use my microwave for quick reheating so it's not a big deal to me. Worth getting used to for the extra space gained. Plus, it microwaves as quickly as its replacement even though the wattage is less.
