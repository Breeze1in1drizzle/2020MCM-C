As is common in these free-thinking, immoral days an unwed single mother left her unwanted child on my doorstep. At first I tried to phone social services they called me a racist homophobe and hung up. The police were similarly unhelpful. What was I to do? My wife suggested drowning him, but the council forces us to sort our rubbish at gunpoint, and which recycling bag do babies go in? It was clearly not the answer.<br /><br />Several times I tried leaving him at the local park, but no-one would take him - not even the strange homeless man with the 'Jesus is Love' sandwich board. It looked like we were doomed to a life or depressing parental drudgery.<br /><br />Then we discovered the 3ct Diamond Pacifier. At first we were skeptical - diamonds are mined in the third world, where poor people live! But we did notice it is pleasingly shiny and pacifier-shaped. Anyway, for less than the price of buying up the whole planet's nuclear weapons, we were rid of our problem! We simply popped it in his mouth and left him in what the proletariat call a shopping mall. He was gone in seconds!<br /><br />Thank you! If only all of life's problems could be solved by buying a $17,000 diamond pacifier. Unfortunately only most of them can.
