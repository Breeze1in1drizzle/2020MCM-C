I bought two of these, one for each upstairs bathroom. The arrived quickly and at first glance, I was intimidated about installation. Then after reading the instructions, and seeing that they actually include a paper guide, you just tape to your wall and drill holes where the dots are... I installed both of these completely by myself! (I am a stay at home mom, so that IS a big deal!) It took no time and they both were up! They brace very solid against the wall. The dryer worked quite well and was very quiet compared to our old dryer. It also has automatic shut off, you can even hang it up while it is on and it will shut off as it is put back into the cradle. VERY NICE! I would buy again in a heartbeat!
