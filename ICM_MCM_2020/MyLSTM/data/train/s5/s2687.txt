Best pacifier on the market hands down! We have tried many pacifiers like the soothie (which she liked for a little while but never kept it in well) and avent pacifiers but she took to these the best. She isn't a big pacifier baby until recently as her teeth began coming in. She can keep it in her mouth well especially at night for bed time. It's easy to clean and is comfortable for her.
