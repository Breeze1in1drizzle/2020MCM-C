A friend bought these for me for my newborn baby girl and she loves them. They are very light-weight, which is a must for newborns. These were my daughter's first pacifiers and I tried another brand just recently and even though they were marked for 0-6 months, they were too heavy for her to hold in her mouth (she's 4 weeks old), so back to MAM!
