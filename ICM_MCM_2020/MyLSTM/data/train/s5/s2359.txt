These are on our top-ten list for &#34;baby-must-haves&#34;. Absolutely love every aspect of them, the guilt free components (environmentally/baby safe), the easy to clean factor, and now that baby is older - the fact that this can be a strap on (with paci clip) paci and teether in one! So convenient and quality.
