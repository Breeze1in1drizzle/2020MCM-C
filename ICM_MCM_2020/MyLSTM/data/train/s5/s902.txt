Can't believe how small and yet powerful this little thing is!  Best travel hairdryer ever thanks to the ultra compact size and low wattage.  Will be perfect for our trip to Europe.  Wife used it a few times to see how it worked and she is &#34;blown away&#34; (excuse the bad pun).  It really is all you could want in a travel sized hair dryer and you won't believe how small it is, but don't let that scare you away!
