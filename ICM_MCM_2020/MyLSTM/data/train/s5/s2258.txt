My baby loves this pacifier. It is very thin across the gum line and has a nice size for the bulb. She's had other MAM pacifiers and this is her favorite. I like the design of the plastic outer part as it allows for good airflow. I would recommend this pacifier - especially parents who use MAM bottles. The MAM perfect pacifier has a truly unique design.
