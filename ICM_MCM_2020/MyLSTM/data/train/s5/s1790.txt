I ordered these because these are the kind of binks that my kid likes. He is very soothed by them and goes right back to sleep if Im quick enough. I saw that the colors could vary, but if I really cared that much about what color the things were I would have driven my lazy butt to the store and picked some out in person. I put the pink one up as an emergency back up and attached the green and blue one to his pacifier clip. Tragedy averted.
