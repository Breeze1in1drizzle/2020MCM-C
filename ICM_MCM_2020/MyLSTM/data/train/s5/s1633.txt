I had found a small blue cube micro wave some years ago.  After 16 years of service it finally wore out.  I love the cube shape and took a risk on ordering this little gem.  I couldn't be happier.  It is the great same size, the outside is fabulous and it has more power than the last microwave. Would not hesitate to purchase this again! Totally worth the price.
