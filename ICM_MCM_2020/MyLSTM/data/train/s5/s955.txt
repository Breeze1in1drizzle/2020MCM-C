After returning to Amazon a dryer that claimed to have a low noise level but did not, this one delivered on its promise.  Also, the diffuser is easier than some to use because you don't have to line up anything to put it on or remove it--it's a simple push on and pull off.  Have just started using this, so can't speak to its durability.
