I love this blow dryer!!! I have never really put much thought into the types of blow dryers I have used in the past. I thought severe breakage, damage and dry hair were the negatives that came with the territory. Boy, was I wrong!!! This blow dryer dries my hair REALLY fast and the results are great! My hair is much silkier and not dry at all! I can almost skip the flat iron, and I have really course/curly hair!!! I have used the dryer twice so far and my breakage has been reduced dramatically!!! This dryer is lightweight and I love the 2 concentrator nozzles that come with it! The cord is nice and long as well!!! Although it was expensive, I think I have found a winner!!! My old &#34;CHI&#34; can't touch this!!!
