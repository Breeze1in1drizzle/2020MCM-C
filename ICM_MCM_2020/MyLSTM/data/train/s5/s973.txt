This hair dryer is the most powerful I've ever used. It actually kicks when you start it, that's how much air rushes out of the nozzle. The warm air drying field - because of the dryer's unusual strength - is wider and more focused than any other that I've tried. The controls are remarkably easy to use. They require hardly any pressure, seeming to respond instantly when pressed. Ergonomically the Remington Ac2015 is well designed, fitting in my hand quite comfortably. Other hair dryers are often indifferently designed, their weight soon tiring your hands and arms requiring constant switching between left and right hands. This dryer stayed in my right hand without cramping or fatigue, which I really appreciate.<br /><br />The three heat settings and two speeds are perfect for the subtle changes your hair undergoes during the drying process. There's a big difference between the extremely wet hair you confront when first leaving the shower and the dryer, more responsive hair you have after a couple of minutes of drying. With the different heat settings and two speeds - coupled with the dryer's strength - I manage to avoid some of the heat damage that I used to inflict on my hair. Back then, I was forced to crank-up my inferior dryer in order to get better (and quicker) drying. Heat damaged, overly dry (even dessicated) hair is unmanageable and very unsightly. I am thankful those days appear to be gone for good. The attachments are easy to add and use though I never need them, finding the dryer in its native state to be best for my hair. The dryer runs quietly and without sparking, something that can be worrisome when your hands are moist. There's a four year warranty which indicates the confidence the manufacturer has in this well-made dryer. The Remington Ac2015 is an excellent professional grade dryer that is easy to recommend.
