My old Conair burnt out after about 10 years of use. I debated spending more money on a pricier model, but saw the reviews for more costly hair dryers were hit or total miss. I decided on this dryer, it came with a concentrator nozzle and a diffuser. I've used both and I love this dryer. It gets the job done. I just wish that the cord was retractable (like my old Conair dryer).
