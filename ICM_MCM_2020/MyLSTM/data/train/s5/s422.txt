This is the hair dryer I have been looking for.  I have had an ionic dryer many years ago and had trouble finding one that actually works as they are supposed to.  I tried this one that my daughter had,  and bought the same one.  I have very short, straight, thinning hair. This dryer does not frizz my already fragile hair.  It works beautifully to dry my hair without the frizz and dryness of most other brands that I have tried (even ones that say they are &#34;ionic&#34;.<br />  My only complaint is that the concentrator does not swivel, causing me to twist my hand while holding it, instead of moving the concentrator into a different position.<br />  Other than that, I would certainly buy this hair dryer again.  Bonus - A GREAT price for a GREAT dryer.  Much less expensive than others and does just what I wanted it to do!
