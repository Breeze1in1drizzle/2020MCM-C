This is a GREAT dryer and my review will compare the Sedu Revolution 4000i with the Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000.<br /><br />When the Harry Josh 2000 dryer came out I was dying to buy it but just couldn't justify the price. I was in desperate need of a good dryer (since I straighten my hair almost every day).  After lots of research and reading reviews on every single dryer out there, I decided to go with the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i. Especially since it was chosen by Harry Josh himself as HIS FAVORITE DRYER (obviously before he developed his own dryer)¡­so I figured the Sedu was a great choice. I've loved this dryer since day 1. Love it. But¡­I still had my heart set on the Harry Josh dryer. I figured it would be even better than the Sedu and somehow cut my dry time to mere seconds :)<br />I finally justified the purchase of the Harry Josh by telling myself that my Sedu would be my travel / back up dryer. After all, everyone needs an emergency blow dryer!<br /><br />So the Harry Josh dryer arrives and I immediately notice it's the same exact body casing as the Sedu. Even the attachments are exact and fit on both dryers. EVERYTHING and I mean everything right down to the cord length, switches, markings and body size were exact. Even the motor sounds exactly the same when turned on. The only difference I can see is that one is mint green and one is black.<br />Now I admit, I don't know what kind of motor each one has, but it seemed strange to me that Harry's new $250-300 dryer appears to be the exact same machine as his once beloved &#34;favorite dryer.&#34; So I decided to perform my own dry test and see which one, if any, dried my hair faster and made it smoother.<br /><br />I tested for six total days. For three days I dried with the Sedu and for three days with the Harry Josh. I alternated days to account for weather, humidity in the air, more or less product applied, etc.<br /><br />On all six days I followed the same exact routine (water temp / shampoo / conditioner / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days. On average, using the Sedu, it took about 5:30 min to get my hair dry and approx 7 minutes to dry it with the Harry Josh.<br /><br />The Harry Josh DID make my hair a slightly smoother, but nothing really earth shattering.<br /><br />I decided to keep my Sedu and return the Harry Josh.<br /><br />Note: My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length, curly, fine, and a little frizzy. It's also color treated.<br /><br />So all in all, I highly recommend the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i dryer. Even though it's expensive it's totally worth it if you straighten your hair a lot. I'm thrilled with mine.r / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days.
