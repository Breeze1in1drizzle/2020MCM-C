I believe we have ordered this wubbanub monkey about 4 times. My daughter has loved wubbanubs since she was born (she is 2-1/2 now) and the monkey is her favorite. since she does have a full set of teeth the pacifier will get cracks in it and we cannot give it to her anymore. We just order another one and she doesn't know the difference. She has also had the wubbanub duck, giraffe and baby doll. When the pacifier got a hole and needed to be removed from the baby I just detached it and now the baby is her favorite thing in the world.
