I have a very old Conair Prostyle 1600 - my favorite hand held dryer, and after over 10 years, it's been on its way out.  I've tryed various dryers, but none of them have the great feel of my old Conair.  I just recently ordered the Conair Yellowbird 1875...thought it would be great - looked just like my old one, only yellow.  I tried it once and sent it back.  It was too heavy..unlike the Conair 1600, which was oh so light...and surprisingly didn't have the blow power I expected.  So I read one review on the Andis Pro Style 1600 and it sounded good.  I tried it this morning and it's perfect - very light...and so small, I couldn't believe it.  I travel on business and have not found a travel dryer I'm happy with, so I'm going to order another of these for a travel dryer.
