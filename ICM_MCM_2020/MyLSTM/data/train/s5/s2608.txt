I never thought I would purchase this, but it's been a ilfesaver. Now I always have an extra pacifier on hand, and I don't have to dig through my huge diaper bag to find an extra - comes in handy when baby is screaming and her pacifier is nowhere to be found!  It's not absolutely necessary, but it has made life easier more than once! It also matches my diaper bag perfectly.
