These are the real deal GumDrops from Hawaii Medical. These are the only pacifiers that our two sons would take. Beware of other products called GumDrops, but not made by Hawaii Medical -- these here are slightly firmer and hold up well over time. We like the GumDrops over the green Soothies (from the same company) given the nose cut-out at the top of the paci.
