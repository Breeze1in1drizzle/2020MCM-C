I purchased these for my daughter when she was 4 weeks old and at nearly 4 months we're still using them! They're so fun and much easier to keep ahold of then a single pacifier. Plus having something to snuggle with or teeth on is a bonus! They're light weight and brightly colored so she's still fascinated by them.
