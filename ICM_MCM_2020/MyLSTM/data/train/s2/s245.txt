We bought this mwo 20 months ago and were satisfied until the magnetron failed at 20 months, which is unacceptable!  Since the magnetron has a 10-yr warranty, we checked for local authorized repairmen, but there  were none close enough to make the repair worthwhile, since we have to pay for labor.  Check this out before you buy.
