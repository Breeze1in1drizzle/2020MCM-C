just like another reviewer wrote - the bonnet's elastic is so tight that it hurt my head and I didn't have very large rollers on. I took her advice and took out the elastic and put in a long shoe lace which was a very time consuming and frustrating job but it worked. Plus I don't know how anyone could sit there with the setting on high. The medium setting is almost too hot. If I hadn't read the her review about replacing the elastic, I would of sent it back.
