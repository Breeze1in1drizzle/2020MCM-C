I gave this hair dryer to my wife in mid-April for her birthday.  She loved it.  It got VERY hot and dried her hair in about 10 minutes, which was a whole 10 minutes less than any other dryer she had used.  Everything was peachy until about a month ago (September) when all of a sudden it started making a terrible squeeling noise which required a bang on the counter to get working properly.  The constant banging lasted for about a month and now it squeels and doesn't get hot anymore.  All said and done, this is a great dryer if you only want it for 4 months, but for this kind of money I would have expected it to last a lot longer!
