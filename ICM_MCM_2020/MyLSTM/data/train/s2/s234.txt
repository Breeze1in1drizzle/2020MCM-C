It's noisy. You can end up pushing it off the table before the door release works. I have to use two hands to open the door, one to hold it from moving while I push the door release with the other. The plastic printed button cover is already starting to show signs of ware after only a few weeks of use. The buttons are hard to locate the center of and actually operate. It doe's a great job on popcorn though.
