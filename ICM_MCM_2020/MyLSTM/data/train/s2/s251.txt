what a huge waste of money!  We bought this microwave specifically because it would fit into the little compartment of my husband's OTR truck.  We've never had issues getting a microwave to work in the truck before... and to make matters worse when my husband called their posted phone number for assistance he kept getting passed around from one 'um, I don't know' person to the next.  We would have returned the microwave IF he hadn't already put it in the truck and left from home BEFORE he discovered that it doesn't work on the power source (why not... we still don't know).  Looks like he puts back in the too large microwave and has to take it out and set it on the bunk in order to make a meal.<br /><br />We gave it a 2 because it is the perfect size and it DOES work if you want to use it in a house, but for some reason will not work with the power inverter OTR trucks use.
