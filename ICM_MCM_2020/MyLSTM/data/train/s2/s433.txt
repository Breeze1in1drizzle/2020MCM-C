These were very disappointing. Each cloth is so wet that I have to literally 'wring out' the moisture before I actually use them. It then leaves behind a lot of moisture. I bought these to use to clean my pump parts when taking my pump to the office. The Munchkin Arm & Hammer wipes work much better!!
