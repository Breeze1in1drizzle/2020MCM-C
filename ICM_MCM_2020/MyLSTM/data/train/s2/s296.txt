I had such high hopes for this product. The concept is great and I desperately needed something to help my newborn keep a pacifer in her mouth. But, alas, this was not the product. While cute, it didn't have enough weight to do the job. It popped out of her mouth as often as a normal pacifier. It is now sitting in a drawer somewhere.
