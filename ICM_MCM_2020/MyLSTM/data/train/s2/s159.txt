Exceeded my expectations while it worked.  I read the reviews about the hair dryer suddenly dying, but gambled that it wouldn't happen to me.  Wrong.  Turned it on this morning and nothing happened.  Completely dead.  I will contact Remington but don't expect the problem will be remedied.<br /><br />Oh well, the search continues.
