This WAS a great hair dryer for a couple of months. I received the dryer in May and used it regularly for several months. In August I noticed that it just didn't feel hot any more. I pushed all the switches and button up and down, in and out several times to see if something was stuck but no luck, it just stopped blowing hot air.  I immediately contacted Andis via email and asked what I should do about the malfunctioning dryer but as of now, 3 weeks later, no response from Andis. Bummer!
