The concept of the Wubbanub is great however the product is cheaply made and my baby prefers his plain old soothie. We introduced the Wubbanub when he was 3 weeks and he already moved his head too much for it to stay in place. Every time he moved his  head the animal stayed in place and his paci  popped out of his mouth.
