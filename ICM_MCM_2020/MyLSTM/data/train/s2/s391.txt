I personally wouldn't purchase these again. They are very cute, but not as practical as some of the other kinds (other Avent kinds included). My little girl likes to turn the bink around in her mouth, but with this kind only one side is up. They are also more bulky and she's only 10 months old and still seem too big for me.<br /><br />Overall LOVE the Avent brand though. I own binks, bottles, and sippy cups.
