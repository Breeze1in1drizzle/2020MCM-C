As with almost all of the other reviews, which I basically ignored, the battery life does not last.  We bought this to take on an international trip so that we would not be constantly worrying about dirty pacifiers on the plane and in the airport.  We did not even make it from the states to Europe without the batteries dying. And we put fresh batteries the day we left. Better to buy pacifier wipes.
