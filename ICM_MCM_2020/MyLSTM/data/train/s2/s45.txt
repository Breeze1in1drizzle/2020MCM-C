I don't know if my product is defective, I just got it in the mail.  But it is not what I would call a hair dryer.  It doesn't generate much of a wind and it doesn't get very warm.  I would not even consider this something worthy of packing to go on a trip.  I'm going to send it back and keep my nice hair dryer which is just a little bit bigger.
