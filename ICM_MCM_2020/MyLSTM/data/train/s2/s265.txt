Door doesn't open when you hit the button, you have to hold the button in with one hand and then pull the door open with a 2nd hand.  Buttons are cheapy, just a cardboard panel (comes with a 2nd cardboard panel in French to swap out).  Seems like it heats OK, but the door is a deal breaker.  I'm returning it (I've never returned anything from Amazon, but I hate it that much).
