I bought these adorable pacifiers for my 2-month old, as I did not like how the shield on the Soothie pacifier she had been using was so large and was smushing her nose.  The GumDrop's nipple is nice and soft, just like the Soothie, however the GumDrop's shield is made of a firmer silicone.  As my daughter would sometimes put the wrong end of the pacifier in her mouth, I didn't want her to hurt her not-quite-ready-to-teeth gums by sticking the shield in her mouth.  It's not as hard as the silicone/plastic used in some of the Playtex and MAM shields I've seen, but it wasn't the same soft material its nipple is made of.
