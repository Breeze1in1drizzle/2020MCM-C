I received and installed the microwave. So far, I am pleased with it.<br /><br />It was damaged in shipping (a dent on the top back edge. This does not affect the installation or operation. I noted that a number of other reviewers had damage in shipping. This needs to be fixed. Better packaging and selection of carrier might help.<br /><br />The hardware (toggle bolts) were cheap and just fell apart when I used them. i had to use other hardware to install the unit.<br /><br />The template is a bit off. I had to redrill the holes for the top cabinet to get it to fit. I measured the holes on the unit and found the template was off about 3/4 of an inch.
