The reason I chose this one was because of the 3 attached parts, they looked great and useful.  But turned out those cannot be attached.   All three always falled down after ~15 seconds, so no use at all.  This dryer is a little heavy but acceptable because the air is powerful enough to make the hair dry fast.   Overall, I am very disappointed for the special features. Its design has a major problem, should make it just as the bottle top.    Updates 2/21/11  After 7 months, it is not hot enough, just a little more than warm.  My old travel dryer is even better than this.
