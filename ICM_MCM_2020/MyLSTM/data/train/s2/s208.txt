This is a very handsome appliance and for the first year it operated well or as expected. Within weeks of the first year anniversary the microwave died, an operating board went out and it no longer functioned and the repair would cost almost as much as replacing the product. I contacted GE and they instructed me to have a repairman to come in and diagnose the problem, if I decided to repair or replace they would give me credit for the service call, but because the warranty had just run out they would not be responsible for replacing the product.
