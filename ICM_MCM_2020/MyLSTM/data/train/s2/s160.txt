This blowdryer is okay. I orignally bought it because i heard it was a reliable brand and I also needed a new blow dryer and this was on sale with a 4 dollar off coupon. The filter that the air goes in through and then gets heated and comes out the other end so the back side it my hair gets stuck in this everytime i use it! it drives me crazy! So everytime i have to stop the bblow dryer and cut my hair out of it and clean the filter! The smell also i a dirffernt smell that comes out i dont know if thats just because my hair that gets stuck is making it smell because it burned or that its just a differnt blow dryer from my preivou one but i think i might just have t get used to it.
