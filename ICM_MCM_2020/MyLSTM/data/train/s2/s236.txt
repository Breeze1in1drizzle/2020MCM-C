I received this microwave and it didn't work! I plugged it in and tried several outlets, but the clock didn't light up and it didn't respond to me pushing any of the buttons. It was really easy to get a new one from amazon and they shipped it very quickly. So far, the second one has been great and exactly what i wanted. However, I had to return the first one that didn't work and the shipping methods were extremely inconvenient. Ups will only pick it up from my house during the day when I'm at work. I had to take it to the post office, but i don't have a car so i had to carry it and walk several blocks. In addition, the max shipping reimbursement wasn't enough, so i'm out another $5 for their mistake.
