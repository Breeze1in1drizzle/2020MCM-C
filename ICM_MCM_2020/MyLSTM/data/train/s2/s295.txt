The idea behind this item is great but the execution is not.  The pacifier used is not the same quality as if purchased by itself (less durable/softer) it is also not detachable therfore you can't replace it or sanitize it. You have to wash it by hand or in the washing machine which will degrade the material.  I also don't like that they used sand/small filler (think &#34;beanie babies&#34;) in the feet as weights, to me this poses a safety issue.  Repeated washing and babies chewing/sucking can be hard on things and the only thing separating this choking hazard is the stitching. Since my son likes to suck on the feet, I don't give it to him unless I am there to watch closely.
