Microwave functions as expexted but the inside smells bad. I think it's because the steam from food gets 'trapped' inside. After some use, I can see that the door has moisture droplets. I think this is what cause the bad smell. My old microwave of ten years never had this problem. With this one, I have to leave the door open after use, and have to clean the inside frequently. I didnt have to do any of these for my old one. Will not recommend this microwave.
