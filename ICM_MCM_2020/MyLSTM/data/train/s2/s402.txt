These pacifiers are way too big....my baby girl can't breath properly as they almost cover her whole nose, which prevents her form being able to suck on the pacifier....and she's 3 months old!...they could have made them smaller and I would have given them 5 stars!....oh well, maybe when she's 5 or 6 months she'll be able to suck on them...but then I'll have to buy another set of pacifiers for 6 months plus!...
