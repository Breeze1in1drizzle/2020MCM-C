I had the old Silver bird and it was so much better than the new one that is being sold now in some stores. The old one was really hot and straightened my hair so much better. This new one seems to even vibrate a bit when using and just feels cheap. It takes longer now to blowout my hair. You can tell if it's the old one because the word silverbird looks like the one shown.
