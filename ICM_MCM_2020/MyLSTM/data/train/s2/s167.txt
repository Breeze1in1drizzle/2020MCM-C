I purchased this based on a write up in Prevention Magazine.  Yes, a great dryer with lots of shine BUT the locations of the control button stink!  I spend more time reselecting the temperature/speed/on & off, as no matter how you hold this dryer, you are pressing a switch.  I would recommend this to NO ONE!  It's just poorly designed!
