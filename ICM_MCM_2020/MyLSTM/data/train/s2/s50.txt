having owned a couple of the predecessors of this dryer, which were always quite satisfactory, I find this newly designed mounting system to be a poor excuse for a mounting bracket.  The screws meant to hold the dryer to the bracket are totally inadequate..too small to withstand the torsion of removing and replacing the dryer on the bracket.  I can't imagine how much was saved by changing to this style, but it certainly leaves a bad taste for the overall quality of the dryer.
