The concept is nice, but as other reviewers pointed out, it closes AS it hits something, not before.  My bigger problem with it is that it's hard, and not soft like most other pacifiers, so his face can get red while sucking on this.  If he were to hit something with it in his mouth, he could probably get really hurt, so we just don't use this because of that.
