I bought this by reading the reviews and also read about it in a  Baby magazine that it's suppose to be very natural and good  But when we got it I gave it my sin who is 6 months he hated it maybe the nipple shape  But he's so use to playtex binkey and also it's very light weight it  Keeps calling of from his mouth and he got angry when I gave him this  I just have it under his pillow in his crib he hardly uses it  I love nuk pacifiers more this is ok and a bit pricey since my kid next uses it  I was a waste of 9$  Ps it catches a lot of lint
