I have been using the Twinturbo 3200 everyday for 11 months. I bought it because I wanted a hair dryer that would blow very hot air. It worked great for about 9 months. After 9 months, the hot air wouldn't stay hot after 5 minutes of being on; it turns to warm air. Also, the diffuser falls off very often while the hair dryer is on. It's quite startling. My previous hair dryer was a SuperSolano that I used everyday for 6 YEARS before it failed. I do not recommend the Pibbs Twinturbo!! I am very disappointed with it.
