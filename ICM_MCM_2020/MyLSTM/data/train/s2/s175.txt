I've used so many different hair dryers, and I've always focused on those that dry quickly and delivers much air flow so my hair doesn't feel burned. If it's quiet, it's a big bonus.<br /><br />My favorite is this: http://www.amazon.com/Sharper-Image-Ionic-Conditioning-SI745/dp/B00007M1U2/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t , the Sharper Image ionic hair dryer. I like the travel version because it's light weight, yet delivers just as much power and air. Too bad this is no longer in production.<br /><br />I also enjoyed this: http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Infusions-Wahl-Pro-Dryer/dp/B001E6G6FC/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top , and I use it as my alternative hair dryer when I can't access my Sharper Image dryer. This one, too, delivers great air flow at an appropriate temperature and dries my hair quickly and gently.<br /><br />Now, to our product at hand... it's heavy compares to the two I had just mentioned. It's not any more quiet. I don't generally use the air diffuser on my Wahl, but I do use it on my Sharper Image. I tried using the diffuser with this Remington, but whether I use it or not, my hair gets very tangled afterward, which isn't a problem with neither of the two I had mentioned. It also does not dry quickly as the title implies, nor does it make my hair feel anymore healthy than before I use it. In fact, rather than taking half the time to dry my hair, I think it doubles the time.<br /><br />My hair is past the middle of my back, so it's a bit long. Maybe this is a great dryer for shorter hair? I don't know. I can't recommend this to others. On the bright side, I get a nice work out with my right arm using it... haha...<br /><br />Two stars, because it works.
