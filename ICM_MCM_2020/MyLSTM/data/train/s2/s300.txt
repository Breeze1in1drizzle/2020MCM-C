Why put all those diamonds on white gold? My one year old hates white gold. She prefers a stronger paci made of platinum. Although In the end it was worth selling our house and moving into an apartment to afford to buy her this. What kind of parent would NOT buy this for their child? A terrible one who does not value money, bling, and absolute ridiculousness! We are currently relocating to a tent to purchase one for our second born ...cuz we be good parents!!
