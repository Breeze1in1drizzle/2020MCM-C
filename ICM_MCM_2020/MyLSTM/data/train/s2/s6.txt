UPDATE: I know this dryer was only $20 but it died after ~1.5 years. This is the first dryer to ever stop working for me, which isn't the best morning surprise. The rest of my review stands. the concentrator never fell off.<br /><br />I bought this hair dryer because the concentrator(?) on my old hair dryer always fell off. One day it started taking my hair with it. I bought the Conair Turbo Styler because the concentrator looked like it would never fall off. I've had this for a few months now, and it definitely stays put.<br /><br />The heat is on the lower end, I have fine hair so that works for me. I wouldn't advise this dryer for somebody with very thick hair.
