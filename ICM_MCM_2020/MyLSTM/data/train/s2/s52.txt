Based on mostly positive reviews I purchased this hair dryer - usually the reviews on Amazon are on target - not this time.  This dryer appears to be well built and fits the space on my wall fine but has two major flaws that make me regret my decision to purchase:<br />1. The night light is way too bright.<br />2. More importantly, the air flow on the high setting is woefully inadequate for me!!!  Trying to dry my hair each morning during this hot summer has been no fun with this hair dryer barely pushing very hot air at me.  It usually leaves me sweating with semi-dry hair.<br /><br />I hate to waste hard earned money, but I'm looking at trashing this unit and finding a replacement (I used to have a Sunbeam model that worked great).<br /><br />Good luck shopping!
