when I received this two pacifier pack, I did not open and checked it immediately. My mother opened it and noticed that one of the pacifier is damaged. I emailed the seller about returning these. The reply asked me to take a picture of the damage. I did it and emailed back, ended up as getting refund for half of the price. I sounds making sense. It was just not a happy shopping experience.
