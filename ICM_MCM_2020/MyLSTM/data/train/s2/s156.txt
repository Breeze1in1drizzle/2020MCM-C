OK, beautiful color, stylish, not heavy seems long lasting probably a good dryer for the right person.  Unfortunately I will have to return it.  This dryer takes a very long time to dry the  hair, it is not hot or powerful enough this should be best for fine hair.  it is kind of uncomfortable to hold as well,  I feel sad since I have to return it but it is not right for me, Love the pink color but what can you do?
