I ordered this set when my triplets were sick.  They hate having their temperature taken, and equally hate taking medicine.  I had hoped that if the thermometer and medicine dispenser were in the form of a pacifier they would take them.  They didn't.  :|  I'm sure the product works fine for others, but NOT ONE of my trio would take either the thermometer or the medicine dispenser.
