The Pink Horse Wubbanub is really cute and well made.  Those are the only positives I can give.  When I opened the package, there was a very distinct petroleum smell to the Wubbanub.  I'm assuming this came from the glue that holds the pacifier in the stuffed animal.  I boiled the pacifier three times (which is difficult) and washed it several times before the smell went away.  My daughter does not like the pacifier at all.  She repeatedly spits it out.  As one of the previous reviewers stated, the Pink Horse is not very big at all, and is of no assistance in keeping the pacifier in my daughter's mouth.  I do not recommend this product.
