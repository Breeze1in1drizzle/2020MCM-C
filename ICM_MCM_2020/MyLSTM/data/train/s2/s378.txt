My son looooves the soothie pacifiers. These, however are not the same as the first years brand. His one from the hospital is still intact months later, but the advent ones cracked in only a couple weeks! I heard a squealing noise while he was sucking, so I took it out of his mouth and there were little cracks all the way around the nipple part. I pulled on it and it started to tear. I'm so glad he didn't choke on this! I will not be buying this brand again. Save yourself some money and the get the real one at toysrus for $4.
