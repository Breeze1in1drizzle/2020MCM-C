Loved this when I first got it, purchased after reading really great reviews. However, I noticed that the top got really hot, and several weeks after purchase it got so hot that it shut itself off! This didn't happen again, so I kept it, until a month and a half after purchase I went to open the door to put a cup of coffee in and the top part of the handle broke- saw a piece of plastic shoot across my counter. I am returning and getting another brand- not going to waste my money on another of these cheap pieces of equipment.
