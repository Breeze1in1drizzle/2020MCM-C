Many of my friends had these and told me that their babies loved them so I bought one for my 3 month old son. I thought at first that the idea of this item was really great. A combination of a pacifier and stuffed animal seems like it would be so soothing! My son showed no interest in this item and even when I tried to introduce it as he grew he still wasn't impressed. He is 1 year old now and has never used this item. So I guess it depends on the child if they like it or not, but this is not why I am giving it two stars. I am giving it two stars (stars are for the good idea) because this item it almost impossible to clean. You cannot sterilize the pacifier and when you wash the stuffed animal you need to let it air dry (you can't put it in the dryer because of the pacifier). I wish it was made in a way that would allow you to detach the pacifier more easily so that you can clean the stuffed animal and pacifier separately.
