This blow dryer does not get hot enough to straighten curly/thick hair using the tension method. I tried using this on myself; my hair is mostly wavy and with an loose s curl at the ends, and it did nothing for me. My sister tried this too and she has thick hair-- did not work for her either. I was disappointed because I bought this as a Christmas present for her because she needed a new blow dryer. I thought the John Frieda brand would prove useful. I didn't even bother returning it, I just sent it to my family to see if they would find some use for it. Perhaps this would work better for already straight hair or fine hair that you just want to dry faster than letting it air dry.
