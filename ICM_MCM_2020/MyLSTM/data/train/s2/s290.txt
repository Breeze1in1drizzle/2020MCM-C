This pacifier chain is great-looking, but it does not hold up to lots of chewing/sucking.  My son is 4 1/2 months old and puts everything in his mouth.  I checked on the chain after he chewed on it for a while and noticed that 2 beads were cracked!  I ended up having to throw it out since I was afraid the beads would break and become a choking hazard.
