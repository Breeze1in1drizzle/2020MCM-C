I bought this thinking common spray paint might be a bad idea. The can warned of the issue of fumes, which in the usual manor, I ignored. I sprayed my microwave, and man did it smell, and really seemed like I should not have been so casual about the warning. So then I thought, if the fumes are so bad, and they lasted for weeks, how good is this crap to be so close to our food, In my imagination, it seems worse than a can of Rustoleum! Who knows, it was fairly expensive for a small can, and it didn't give me a good feeling, but again, who knows?
