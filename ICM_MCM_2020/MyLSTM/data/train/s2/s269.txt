We purchased this microwave about two years ago. The microwave cooks well but often makes microwave safe dishes too hot to remove from the oven without an oven mitt. We have never had that problem with other microwaves. The alarm settings can't be changed and we found it annoying to hear the microwave beep five times every time it was finished. Unfortunately, it has already died a painful death and must be replaced. We wish we had better researched microwaves before purchasing this microwave.
