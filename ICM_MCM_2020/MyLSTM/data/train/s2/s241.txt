This microwave OVERHEATS if popping more than two or three bags of popcorn!  Once it overheats, it automatically switches to the lowest power mode available, thus making it take forever to heat anything. You have to let it rest for 20 minutes or so to cool down.<br /><br />The microwave works well if you don't use it too much at once.  But for more intensive use, buy something more powerful!!
