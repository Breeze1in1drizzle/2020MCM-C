Loved this microwave when it worked...<br />I never had a problem with its cooking functions, lived/swore by the sensor reheat, and did what it was supposed to.  The problem I encountered was that after owning it for about a year and a half, it suddenly stopped working.  I'd set the time and hit start, the light inside would come on, the clock would count down, but neither the turntable would turn nor would the microwave actually start cooking.<br />I drove it to a Sharp certified technician, and about $65 later, it worked fine.  At least, for another year or so.  Repeated the process, paid another $65, and then it worked fine. This time, for another year.  Thanks to the economy, my Sharp certified technician lost his business, and now I had to drive it over an hour away if I wanted it fixed.<br />I brought it to a Sears service center, where they fixed it for about $50, and they said there was a problem with some kind of safety latch with the door.  This time, it lasted about 6 months.  I agree with other users, that every microwave on the market has some kind of issue.  It's time to accept the fact that we want these machines to do more than they could 15 years ago, and either the craftsmanship isn't there, or our appliances simply can't handle the demands anymore.  I guess 5 years is a decent lifetime now, sadly.
