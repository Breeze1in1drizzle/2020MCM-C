[[VIDEOID:mo1LOHJ4VRRGAJT]]The good: My brand new, out of the box spacesaver is great looking, it is cabinet depth so it doesn't stick out, it fits perfectly under a cabinet (with the kit) and, when you can get the door open, it works really well.   I just completely redid my kitchen and it looks marvelous.      The bad:  the door doesn't open.   Seriously doesn't open. OK, I'm exaggerating.  If you really, really try, you can eventually get the door open.   From day one it didn't open.  See the video demo of my trying to open the door.      The better:  My wonderful local appliance dealer who sold it to me is not going to try to fix it.  They are sending me a new one and taking this one back. There are some benefits to paying a bit more and buying local.        I'll update this review when I get the new one.    I'm really hoping I get a good one like a subset of the microwaves all of you have.    However, you should not have to wish to be a subset when you are paying over $250 for a microwave.  They should all be good, quality microwaves.  There are so few under cabinet, cabinet depth, models available, we are sort of stuck with the GE Spacesaver.    ____________________    July 23, 2011    Update to my review on this microwave.   My appliance dealer send me a new one and it works just fine.   I've only had it about a month, so I don't know how it will last, but as of right now, it is functioning perfectly.
