I have owned a hot tools hair dryer -  model 30001 -  but could no longer use it because the bonnet attachment to the hose broke.  I was very happy with this hair dryer and therefore expected the same results from a newer hot tools hair dryer.<br />However -  the thermostat setting is too too hot..  I cannot use it at all on high  setting and barely on the middle setting -  I have  managed to &#34;get the job done&#34; by starting on the middle setting as long as I can stand it and then switching to the cool setting  and then manually pulling  the bonnet to a peak over my curlers.  My Model 30001 had five heat settings.<br /><br />In addition to this the new dryer is very nosy - almost has a whistle to it.  The bonnet is heavier and not as flexible.<br />In short - I am not happy with the new dryer - do you have another model with more heat settings?<br /><br />A problem with both models -  the hose easily becomes detached from the bonnet while in the process of drying.
