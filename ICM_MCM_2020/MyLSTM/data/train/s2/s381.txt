My breastfed baby loves these and we have ordered two pairs from Amazon and purchased one from Walgreens. One out of each package had a hole in the paci causing my son to suck in air. So out of the 6 we purchased we are left with 2. I am now on the quest looking for another paci. We can't even return because I just threw them away.
