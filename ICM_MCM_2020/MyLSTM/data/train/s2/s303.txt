It is important to note the Super in super soothie means that this is for a baby with teeth it is much harder than the green soothies you first experience at the hospital.  All the packaging says is 3+ months so I bought this thinking they were a little bigger or more appropriate for a 3 month old than the original soothie.  My baby is a little over 3 months and liked them initially but they ended up making him more fussy and irritated his gums.  He is not teething and maybe when he does we will get these out again.  It is important to note that the packaging and the description here does not alert you to the fact that 3+ really means teething or with teeth.  I found that description on the manufacturers website.  I give it 3 stars because it appears to be the same good quality, but I think it is important to note that it is confusing.
