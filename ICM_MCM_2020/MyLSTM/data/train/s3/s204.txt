I like the hairdryer, but am disappointed in the purchase. It was labeled as new, but when I got it I noticed that the filter already had quite a bit of lint buildup and there were little, cut hairs stuck to the velcro cord wrap. I got the feeling that maybe this item had been used in a salon. It looked pretty new, so perhaps it was used as a demo. The new description was therefore misleading.
