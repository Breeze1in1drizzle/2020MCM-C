The pacifier is of good quality however we were very disappointed because we ordered two packs and we know the colors could vary but we made the assumption it would be &#34;like&#34; colors to those it displayed. It showed blue and green and we're having a little boy. We ended up with 2 packs of hot pink and purple :(  Baby doesn't know the difference, it's just we weren't expecting it. Just an FYI that it literally could be ANY colors.
