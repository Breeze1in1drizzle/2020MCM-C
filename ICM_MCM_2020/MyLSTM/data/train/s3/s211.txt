I'm surprised at all the fantastic reviews. It's fine, it works (so far, we'll see), but there is nothing outstanding or amazing about this dryer. It is not faster than any previous dryer I've used, my hair isn't softer or fancier. I do appreciate the ability to set to cool without holding down the button. So, it is what it is and comes with a fair price. Take it or leave it.
