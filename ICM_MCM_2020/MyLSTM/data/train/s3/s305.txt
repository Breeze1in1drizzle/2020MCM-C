Fits perfectly in previous Sharp model space.  Heating seems the same as the previous model although this one states 850 watts and the old one said 1100 watts.  Exhaust does not work as well as the other model.  Fan seems to work same on low and high speed, no difference in sound or intensity of fan sound.  One would think the low would seem quieter.
