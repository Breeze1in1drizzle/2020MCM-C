This hair dryer is decent.  It is quieter than my previous hair dryer, but I wish it was a little quieter, especially since being quiet is supposed to be one of it's key features.  I love whatever material it is made of.  Whatever it is made from isn't a slick plastic, so it doesn't slip around in your hands or on the counter, which is nice.  I would say it is right in the middle as far as weight goes, so if you need a light hair dryer, this is not for you, but it's not so heavy that I feel like I am getting a workout.  I also do not feel that it dried my hair any faster than my previous hair dryers. So, it's not a bad hair dryer, but it's also not all that special.  I would recommend it to others if it is on an AWESOME sale, otherwise, try something else.
