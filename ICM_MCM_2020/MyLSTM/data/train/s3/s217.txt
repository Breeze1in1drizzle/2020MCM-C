I've owned 3 of these hair dryers now. They would break after a year or so, but given the low price and quality while it worked, I had no problem replacing it. This newer version is not as impressive. The eco options are great for the environment, but it takes twice as long to dry my hair. The heat is no where near even the middle option on previous versions. Might be great for those who don't need a quick dry and like the lower temperatures, but it was not what I am looking for.
