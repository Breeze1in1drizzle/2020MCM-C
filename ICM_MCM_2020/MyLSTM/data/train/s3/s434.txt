We started using the monkey wubbanub when my son was five weeks old.  He loved it and so did we for several months.  At four and half months though we had to toss it.  We caught our son choking on the monkey's arm.  He literally swallowed the arm and luckily,  my husband was able to pull it out of his mouth.  I think the age limit suggests six months, but I would recommend that parents stop using these once their child starts teething.  We never gave it to him without being present, and I am relieved that no permanent harm was inflicted.
