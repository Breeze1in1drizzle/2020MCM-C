It's OK but not perfect.  The 'buttons' are hard to see in dim light and offer zero tactile feedback.  It's way to easy to hit the 30 second button more than one time if you're not careful.  I stuck some small felt adhesive pads over the buttons I use frequently. That helped quite a bit. You can find them in low light and when you press it you know it.
