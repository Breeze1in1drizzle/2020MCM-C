decent hairdryer. It gets really hot. Doesn't have separate buttons for air level and heat level. Instead it has one heat setting. Only one button that toggles between off high and low. the comb attachment is pretty flimsy and will have to be replaced as the teeth in the comb breaks pretty easily. I use this on my daughters hair. We are Black and she has natural thick and curly hair.
