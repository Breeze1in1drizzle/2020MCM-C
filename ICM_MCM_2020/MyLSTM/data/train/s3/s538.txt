Honestly I wanted to wait to add my review and Im glad I did. First off, its super cute! It does its job and helps to hold the paci and we have yet to lose it either so thats great. When I first got it I thought &#34;I wonder how long before that comes off the animal&#34; as it didn't look all that stable.<br />Its been maybe a month and its barely hanging on there. My son is 11 weeks and doesn't grab things yet to pull or anything and it hasnt been washed even though the label says you can...its literally just falling off :( Very sad since its so expensive too
