I do not have this particular microwave; though I do have a Sharp 1100 Carousel and feel compelled to comment.  Originally I had another Sharp model.  After about six mos. the door would not close properly.  With a little shoving you could get it to operate but I found that a bit alarming.  Walmart (where we puchased) let us exchange it for the above model.  After less than a year a couple of the keypad numbers do not function - I have to choose another number.  It's such a shame that what you thought was a quality product you could depend on is no longer.
