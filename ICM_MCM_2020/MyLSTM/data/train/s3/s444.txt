I loved the idea of a natural rubber pacifier, since I want to expose baby to as few toxic substances as possible. I bought these, as well as some [[ASIN:B003O1IA1S Bornfree Coolflow Pacifiers 2 Pk]], which are BPA and phalate free. Baby did not seem to have a preference as far as nipple shape on the pacifiers, but disliked when the rounded part of the pacifier would smash his nose. I was concerned about it when he slept, because it blocked his nose airways and seemed like it made him uncomfortable. Ultimately, the idea was better than the execution of the product, and we now exclusively use the Born Free pacifiers.
