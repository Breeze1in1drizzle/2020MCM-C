As usual I have my wife test out the hair dryers as she is the one with the hair...<br /><br />I think the design is beautiful. She thinks the dryer is ugly. She said it's a high quality dryer, but overall she prefers our John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer (which costs something like 75% less than this model).<br /><br />My wife has thin hair which is easily damaged. She sees absolutely not difference with the &#34;Nanoe Technology&#34;. The ionizing and &#34;moisture-rich nanoe particles&#34; were dismissed by her as a marketing ploy. I'm not sure about that but will say that at the very least mileage will vary.<br /><br />My wife DOES like the power, and the separate speed and temperature controls.<br /><br />My conclusion? If you have the money and like the design it's a well-built and very functional dryer. If you just want a good reliable dryer you can find good ones for far cheaper.
