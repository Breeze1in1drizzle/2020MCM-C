Other than that it's fine. I have one other minor objection. I mounted mine in the leg well under the dressing area on the left side. There one can see the led light leaking out the bottom of the cabinet and not just through the bezel that it is supposed to. the light leak is something I could fix with RTV silicon, I just haven't bothered. A better design would include a case that fits better to it's base and doesn't leak light, and would also only have the light on when it's dark instead of all the time. Again, it's not quiet. We bought it for our guest bath, so as much as our guests stay here they shouldn't go deaf. No way I'd put up with this noise if it was our primary. This unit doesn't deserve to call itself quiet, so if you need quiet keep shopping.
