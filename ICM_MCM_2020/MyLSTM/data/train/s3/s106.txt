I was really excited about this hairdryer and it's retractable cord, but it really hasn't lived up to the original excitement. As a hairdryer, it's just okay. It's no better than the one I used before, but it does, of course, serve its purpose. Although the cord does retract, sometimes it doesn't retract all the way. Overall, it's not a bad dryer. I was just hoping for more.
