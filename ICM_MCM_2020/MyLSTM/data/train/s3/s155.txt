I have a bad neck and muscle spasm in my left trapizius so it's difficult to lift my left arm. The blo and glo holds my hair dryer so I can use my right arm to style my hair. I only wish that it could be left up permantently on my mirror with my blow dryer in it, but it can't. It has to be removed after each use or it will fall down on its own - it happened the first time I used it. I didn't know I couldnt leave it up (even though the directions say to take it down after each use - I didn't read that far - my bad). So, other than the hassle of taking it down each time I am happy with this product.
