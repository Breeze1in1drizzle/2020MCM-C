My 7 week old son loves the Soothie he got in the hospital, and we're both breast and bottle feeding.  He had a tongue and lip tie that we just got corrected. And, he's having some issues with latching, so I wanted to try something different, that might help with his breast latch.<br /><br />Anyway, compared to the Soothie, the outer shield is larger on the Natursutten.  The Soothie doesn't cover my son's nose, but the Natursutten goes up halfway over his nostrils.  But the part that goes in the baby's mouth is much much smaller.  The Soothie mouth-piece is about the size of a Crayola Marker (about 1/2 inch diameter), whereas the mouth-piece on the 0 - 6 month Natursutten is about the size of a Bic pen where it connects to the shield, and the bump on the end is about the size of a Skittle.<br /><br />There is also a rubber smell to it, as well as a squeak.  It's almost like sucking on a balloon.<br /><br />If your baby likes the Soothie, this may not be a good all natural alternative.
