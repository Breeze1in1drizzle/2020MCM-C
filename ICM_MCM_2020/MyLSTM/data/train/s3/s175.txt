This is a decent hairdryer, but a bit cumbersome to use - it's larger than I thought it would be. Like really large. I recently purchased hot-boxed hair extensions, and bought this to make my life a bit easier (as I can't blow-dry upside-down), after a recommendation by my hair stylist. It works super well at the top of my hair (it looks amazing), but it's very difficult to maneuver around the head, especially the back, due to the weight, the size, and the brush. Make sure you give yourself enough time to dry your hair, as it will take a while trying to use this.
