I had high expectations for this hair dryer and I am deceived. I bought it to replace my Babyliss hair dryer (dropped it too many times...) and preferred the Babyliss.     This Fhi hair dryer is a bit heavy, and it didn't make my hair shiny and soft AT ALL. It didn't even dry my hair faster than Babyliss, but I have to say I didn't try it on at the highest setting, cause it looked to me wayyyyy too hot for my hair to handle without major damage.     I guess I'll get used to it, but I wouldn't recommend someone else to buy it, not worth the price.
