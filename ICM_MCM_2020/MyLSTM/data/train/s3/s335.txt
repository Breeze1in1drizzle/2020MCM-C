This microwave came with our new home. It can be vented outside or inside- ours is vented inside and there is always grime on cupboards above our range where the outlet is, and we really don't fry that much. So plan to vent this outside or do a lot of scrubbing. The fan is VERY LOUD, so if you like to have a conversation anywhere in the house while cooking, this may not be the product for you. Again, this might be better if vented outside. Microwave itself works good, defrost function is handy.
