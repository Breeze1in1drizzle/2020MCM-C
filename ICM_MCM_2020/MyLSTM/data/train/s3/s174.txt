I am an African American women with thick 4B/4C natural hair.  I bought this after reading some good reviews and I have to say it wasn't that great for me.  I thought it would be a bit more powerful blowing wise and it was just didn't have the blowing power I expected and didn't blow my hair out as straight as I am used to.  The heat settings were just ok also. I almost could not feel the difference in medium and high heat and to be honest I much rather prefer the dryers with separate heat and speed settings because you have more control over how much heat your using to dry your hair.  The comb attachments are cheaply made ans definitely seem like the break easily.  Overall its a decent blow dryer but not the best you can get for the price.  I'm actually returning mine to get something better.
