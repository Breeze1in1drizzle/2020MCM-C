A nice hairdryer, it does what we need. We were disappointed that there was no out of the way storage for any  excess power cord and that the power cord was not coiled to reduce the length of usable cord.<br />It is now three years later, and I must revise this review. I guess that three years is probably not terrible for the life of a hair dryer, but for something used less than five minutes a day my wife was expecting better. About a year ago it began making an extra noise when it was infrequently switched to high speed, so she really limited that use. Anyhow, right at the three year anniversary of its first usage, the propeller<br />blades disintegrated and jammed the motor causing it to begin smoking and smelling really bad before she could get the plug pulled. We certainly will not be replacing it with a like unit.
