I got this item on sale. I like that it is small and my diffuser fits on to the end (the nozzle on my old dryer was too wide), but the coolest setting is still quite warm, and it starts to smell like it's overheating after about 10 minutes of use. I have short hair, so I only use it for about 10 minutes, but overall, it gets the job done.
