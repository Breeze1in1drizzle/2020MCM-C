I needed a quick replacement for my spare dryer and wasn't interested in spending much money.  This one has two settings, a nice grip, and a little loop for hanging it.  It does not have a no heat setting like the one it replaced, and is pretty noisy.  Ours has also, after just a couple of months of daily use, developed a bit of a rattle when used at certain angles, which to me indicates that it might have something loose or just out of tolerance and that the dryer may not hold up long term.  While this met my needs, I'll likely be replacing it with a more expensive, slightly fancier model.
