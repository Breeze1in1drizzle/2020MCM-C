Steel case was damaged on back side.  Was able to us because it was hidden when installed under cabinet.  The only complaint about the unit itself is the stainless steel interior gets scotched from the glass turntable plate unless you rare VERY careful.  The microwave/oven features are great.  Very easy to use and looks great!
