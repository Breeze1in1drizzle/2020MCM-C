We purchased this model in white last month and just installed it a week ago. Easy to install and looks very nice. The downside with this is there's no operating instructions except for a few basic ones printed on the face of the unit when you open the door, and they are not adequate. I still haven't figured out how to simply thaw a 1/4 cup of frozen blueberries for my cereal in the morning - very frustrating. It DID do a very even job of reheating a casserole, but the lack of a booklet to reference is very disappointing. Once I am able to figure out how it use it more efficiently, I'm sure I will be happier with it.
