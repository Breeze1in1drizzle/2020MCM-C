It's a bit of an inconvenient game because you have to cut every single pacifier out. Also, it just killed my OCD that the poster itself and many of the pacifiers are creased because the game comes folded in a package. If you've spent so much time making the decor for your party pretty, the creased game will detract from that. Having said that, my guests really did enjoy playing this game. You might be better off making your own, prettier version of this game.
