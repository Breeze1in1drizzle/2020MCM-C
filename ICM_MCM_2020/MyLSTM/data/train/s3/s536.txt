I want to love this steamer, really I do.  When it works, it's awesome.  We got it to sterilize bottles in the hospital while our daughter had open heart surgery.  Heres the issue, you have to be beyond precise with how much water you pour in or the steamer doesn't work.  This precision is marred by the fact that the bottles you put in are wet so they drip water and change your water levels.  It can make an overtired parent crazy.  Plus, if you put too mUch water in, during the steam function, all of the water spills out on your counter and if you aren't watching the steam cycle for the full 10 minutes, the water can spill off of your counter and ruin your hardwood floor.  So, from experience, I recommend putting a jelly pan underneath the steamer...
