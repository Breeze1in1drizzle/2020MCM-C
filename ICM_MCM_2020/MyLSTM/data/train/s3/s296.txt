I＊m always in search of a hair dryer that can blow dry my thick, curly hair as well as my stylist does. (I know ＃ I know ＃ it＊s the person not the tool.) When she dries it, she barely has to touch it up with a flat iron. When I dry it ＃ I have to do a little more work to straighten out the wavy stragglers.<br /><br />This review compares the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, Remington T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer, and this one (Remington Damage Control (DC) Ceramic Hair Dryer).<br /><br />All of them have:<br />  * Same wattage<br />  * Three heat settings<br />  * Two speed settings<br />  * Cool shot feature<br />  * Diffuser and concentrator attachments<br />  * Ionic technology<br />  * Ceramic technology<br />  * Hanging loop<br /><br />The Revlon does not come with a removable filter, the two Remingtons do. (The TStudio doesn＊t say it on the box or description. Company website confirms it.) Revlon and Remington Damage Control have tourmaline technology, the TStudio does not.<br /><br />The Revlon＊s concentrator attachment stays on. The Remington＊s fall off often. If I put the dryer down to adjust my hair, it comes off some of the time. It's hot to put it back on.<br /><br />All three take about the same time to dry my hair. I may have gotten slightly better results (less wavy) with the Remingtons than with the Revlon. I say ※may§ because the difference wasn＊t large enough to be clear. Some days I do a better job than others. Human error, you know.<br /><br />The Damage Control felt like it took less effort and the reason is most likely because it＊s the lightest of the three. The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials. But it could be the better quality materials that make it heavier.<br /><br />I can only assume the DC is cheaper than the T|Studio because of its plastic shell even though it has tourmaline technology, which the T|Studio does not.<br /><br />I＊ve yet to try the diffusers. Whenever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That＊s the whole point of going curly 每 not having to do any hair drying. As for noise 每 I can＊t answer which one is quietest because I＊m deaf. It＊s not a good idea to wear hearing aids while drying wet hair. :)<br /><br />The winner? The Remington DC because it takes the least amount of effort to use and produces the same results as the others. The T|Studio is just too heavy and the Revlon doesn＊t perform as well as the DC.<br /><br />Update November 16, 2015: I downgraded the dryer from 5 stars to 3 stars because the heating element is giving out. It has been getting as hot in the last couple of weeks. When I switched back to an older dryer, I could see a big difference. Lasted only three months.enever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That＊s the whole point of going curly 每 not having to do any hair drying.
