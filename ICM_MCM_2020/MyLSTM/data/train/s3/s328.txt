It's a decent microwave, no better or worse than others I've had over the last 30 years in terms of cooking.<br /><br />If it looks nice in your kitchen and matches your other appliances, it might be worth considering.<br /><br />However, please know that this is the first time I've ever had a microwave that wont' let me set a timer while cooking.  Nor will it let you cook food in it while a timer is running.
