I have multiple Remington hairdryers and this is my least favorite.  It is loud and heavy to hold.  It actually takes longer to dry my hair than the other ones I own.  Love the color, but thats about it.  The other two Remington hair dryers I own have added benefits of smoothing or taming frizz, etc... this one doesn't do any of that... it's just a normal, no thrills hair dryer and takes almost twice as long to dry my hair on the highest, hottest setting :(  The motor doesn't seem as strong in this one.  Would not purchase in the future.
