This is the only microwave made that fits into my pre-constructed custom cabinet space. My first one lasted 8 years.  When it wouldn't turn off, I ordered a new one.  The first one sent to me would not turn on.  Seems like something was wrong with the key pad. GE's fault,not the distributor or Amazon.  Called Amazon and they credited me immediately and charged /sent me a new one the next day which worked perfectly.  I just returned the first one in the original box with the scanner label they sent.
