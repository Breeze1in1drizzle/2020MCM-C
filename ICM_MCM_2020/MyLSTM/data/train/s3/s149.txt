Got this hairdryer a few days ago. I had to go with a lower watt dryer otherwise I'd be flipping breakers every 5 minutes. It's very pretty. I dig the red.  It took a couple days to get used to holding it as it's a bit bulky. But to be fair my other one had a shorter nozzel and was lighter.  The placement of the setting switches is not optimal. I can't easily switch from low to high and back to low without looking at what I'm doing.  And the hot setting is not very hot. Which, I guess, my hair is thankful for.  But boy does she have great blowing power! It's like being in a wind tunnel. My hair dries in half the time now which is great!  I have used both attachments that came along with it too. I was afraid due to the force of the blowing it would blow those little gadgets right off and smack me upside the head but they stayed put.  The blow dryer is a little louder than I am used to but not a big deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the product. I can overcome the negatives. Hope it lasts!<br /><br />_________________<br /><br />REVIEW EDITED SEPT 2013 =  And there she blows...out!  The heating element died already. I am very disappointed this hairdryer did not last as long as I expected it to. I understand....you get what you pay for....but it should have been longer than this. And I do not have long thick hair to where I am using and abusing the hairdryer. My hair is medium length and fine. It didn't have to work that hard!  I'm disappointed today and back on Amazon to shop for yet another hairdryer.
