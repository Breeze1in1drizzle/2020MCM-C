These were really small. 0-3 months. We couldn't find them any longer in the store (I guess they changed them) and well these were not exactly what we were looking for. My 22 month old does take these when he's awake though and the bigger ones when he sleeps so it worked out, but if you are looking for the old style of these you will be disappointed.
