I bought this item based upon the reviews found here at Amazon. Yes, it is small and powerful, easily carried. It is just about right, almost.     From day one the bearings sound like they are going out. Did I get a defective unit? If yours sounds like mine, you are wondering when it will be going out. But it still works so I keep using it. Does the going out sound bother us. You bet it does!     UPDATED: 12-30-2008  Yep, it did go out about a week ago, so the sounds were the prelude of a unit wearing itself out.  Only lasted several months.
