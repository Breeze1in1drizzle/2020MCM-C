my little one prefers the MAM pacifiers, which have a grip surface on the nipple so the baby can keep it in his mouth easier.  what i DID like about these AVENT pacifiers are the caps that go over the nipple for protection. i like that i can toss it in my diaper bag or purse and not worry about the nipple getting dirty.
