My main issue with this blow dryer is that the attachments slide off easily. I have natural textured African American hair. When I blow dry my hair I split my hair into 6 sections and use a quarter size amount of grapeseed oil in my hair as a natural heat protector. I think the dryer is great for the price but I wish that the attachments were able to lock on way better than they do. When this dryer kicks the bucket I will not repurchase because it is really annoying to keep sliding the comb attachment back on....ugh!
