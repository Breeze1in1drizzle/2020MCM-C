My previous review was denied, and does follow review guidelines. This is what I said previously:<br /><br />Got the package within two days, and for that I am happy!  I am only disappointed that I was unable to choose colors.  I did leave a note that these were for a boy, but received a pink and a purple.<br /><br />3/5 stars for an awesome product with fast shipping but docked for inability to choose the colors of an item you pay for.
