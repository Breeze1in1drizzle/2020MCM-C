This dryer works well, but the outer soft touch clear layer started to peel off after only about 4 weeks after purchasing it.  It's a shame since it looked so nice when it arrived and now it looks beat up and as if I've owned if for five years.  I've had other similar models by Conair in the past, but none ever did this.
