While looking for a hair dryer comparable to the one that just tryed to electrocute me, I found this one. The price was great and it had all the features of the much more expensive one I'd just thrown away. I'd give it a higher review but I found the on/off switch to be in an awkard position. It is a powerful hair dryer and well worth the money.
