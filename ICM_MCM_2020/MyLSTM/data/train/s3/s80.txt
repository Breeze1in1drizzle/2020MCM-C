I came on Amazon trusting the reviews that people would give this product. I bought it because it had high reviews and a great price. With a solid 4 star review, I expected a lot more from this dryer.<br /><br />The issue about this dryer that bothers me the most is the air flow. When you turn it on, it sounds like those cheap kid toys with a wind motor. Then it warms up a bit and you get used to the cheap motor and you dry your hair. It doesn't have enough air force! I mean, it's a standard blow dryer so yes it has good air flow. But I expected something a lot more impressive from the reviews given.<br /><br />On a plus side, it does have good heat.<br /><br />I also thought that the air flow would be solved with that front clamp thingy (the front thingy that pushes the air flow in a very specific direction) but NO! Actually the air feels more dispersed with the front clamp thing. Wha??<br /><br />I guess this comes down to the fact that you get what you pay for. But sometimes I have paid very little and have gotten a whole lot. This was not the case.<br /><br />Mostly, I really wish the reviews would have matched the quality of this product.<br /><br />Disappointed and I would NOT suggest people to purchase this dryer unless you're really looking for a meh whatever kind of dryer with a good cheap price.
