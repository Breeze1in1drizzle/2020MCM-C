I've had this microwave for 2 weeks.  It works, for now.  But the interior light is already flickering while in use.  It's brand new and something is already wrong with it.  GE does not make quality microwaves and they do not stand by their products.  Betting it will only be a matter of time before it winds up in a landfill and I have buy new one.
