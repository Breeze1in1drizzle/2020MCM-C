Believed it or not I wanted my kid to take a pacifier, but he just didn't like them. I breastfeed and he prefers to pacify on the breast. We purchased this in an attempt to try all different kinds to find one he may like. However, he does love to chew on this, you can tell he loves the feeling on his gums. And he may like the smell as it has a very distinct one. At the end of the day, I am not unhappy about this purchase. I think it is worth a try if you are looking for a new pacifier.
