Bought the tun turbo to replace my elchim blowdryer that in had for years. Purchased the twin turbo based on the reviews and that it is lighter weight then the elchim with the same power. I received my new twin turbo and I am pleased with the wright , power and   Attachments I am not pleased with the fact that the of the blowdryer does not have a guard like the chi or the elchim have that protects your hair from being sucked into the motor. Ouch and it burns your hair. Basically you need to be super careful and not rush when using this dryer or your hair will be ruined.
