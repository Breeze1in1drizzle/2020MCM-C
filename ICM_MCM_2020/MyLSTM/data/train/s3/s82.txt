I first saw this hair dryer on a TV show talking about beauty products used by the stars.  Then I noticed my hairdresser had switched to this brand.  His observations were the same as mine.  If you take a lot of time drying hair and the weight of the dryer is an issue, this is a very good purchase.  But your hair will be no shinier or softer than with other dryers.
