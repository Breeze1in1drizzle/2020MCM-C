This microwave fits perfectly with our GE Cafe gas range, which is why we bought it. It's quite heavy - apparently due to the built-in convection oven. Disappointing is the plastic handle, which look like stainless steel, but isn't.  I expect more from an $800 appliance.  Also, if you plan to vent this into the kitchen, make sure you have a cabinet over the microwave that is not more than 13 inches deep.  The microwave vents are on top of the front of the microwave and blow straight up.  Other microwaves have vents that fold open, which is a really cool idea. Again, the GE Cafe falls short here.  Hence, only three stars for now.  I will update this as we use it more.
