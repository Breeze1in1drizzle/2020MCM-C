Bought the leopard version of this blow dryer because of the cheaper price and I LOVE it. It is a great blowdryer and I would recommend it to every hair stylist. UPDATE: now 7-8 months later my blowdryer is broken. I really loved this blowdryer but mine just stopped work and only blows cold air now. Very disappointing.
