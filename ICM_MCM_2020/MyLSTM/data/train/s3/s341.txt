It works.  It does seem a bit cheaply made, but you aren't paying top dollar so you should expect that.  The door isn't real solid feeling, so far no problems though.  We mounted this over stove and the fan had low and high and now only has high.  Not sure what happened but it still works.  Be aware that if this microwave gets too hot (sitting over a self clean oven or cooking at high temps) the fan will kick on and won't shut off.  Fine, but we didn't know that at first and thought it was broken.  It's just trying to cool itself off!  Love the 30 second feature.  So many things just need short time to warm up or soften and so just pop it in, press the 30 sec and it goes.  Easy, fast.  Use that all the time.
