No issues with light (some people mentioned it died).. been working OK for almost a month now.<br />Does the job and does it quite well.. quite powerful and dries hair well.. Now for the price its great! the reason I bought this particular one was because I used it at a hotel and liked the product..<br />Now the reason for 3 stars:<br />The quality of the stand and the plastic itself are quite inferior, feel like it gonna crank in about 3 months, the first one I had received had a mold defect and there was a huge dent in the middle so I returned it and got another piece from amazon (easy (and free) return I should say!). But the fact that its quite plastic-ey and the second one I received had the same dent (just smaller) so the finishing is not that great... but I should add it works and does what it should efficiently! I think i would give it 5 stars if it was $5 more expensive but was better quality/finishing..
