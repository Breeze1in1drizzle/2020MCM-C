I upgraded to this dryer from my basic Conair dryer and thought I would get something good based on the reviews, but really, it was a waste of money to simply buy another blow dryer. It doesn't do anything better than previous ones I've owned, and in fact, seems to make my hair slightly MORE frizzy. Plus, the buttons are placed right where your fingers wrap around, so I had to train myself to hold it differently as the first few weeks I kept switching the buttons in the middle of drying. I've seen other complaints about the motor shorting out, and so far, I haven't had any issues like that, just not really impressed with how it dries my hair. And no way is it really quiet. Pfffft.
