I purchased this when my son was a few weeks old and I started trying to find a paci that he would take.  I had an Avent paci in the box with bottles that I got at my babyshower, when I tried it I found that it covered half his face and was just too big for him at the time. So when I saw that this Paci was made for newborns I decided that this has got to be it... well it wasnt.  When I placed it in his mouth he couldnt even tell it was there!  Its so small that its not usable, and my sons head size is only in the 13%, so I am guessing his mouth size is also on the small side.  After trying various brands the MAM pacifier has worked the best!
