It's ok for the price.<br /><br />The plastic feels cheap, the sliding button occasionally is difficult to move and when removing the difusser, i feel as i may break it. The plug isn't the most secure either, seeming to fit loosely in the socket. Despite this, it gets hot enough for my needs and hasn't failed me yet after about 6 months of use. If you need a cheap blow dryer this is a great pick.
