The fan will come on by itself at random times and will not turn off until I unplug the microwave.  This happened several times over a period of a couple months then again occasionally.  This started happening about 2 years into using it.  It hasn't happened recently, probably not for the last 9 months or more.  Hopefully, it will not return.  The fan is also fairly loud to the point you have to elevate your voice to carry on a conversation.  Everything else is average but it sure looks nice and that is why I was foolish enough to buy it. I would have given it one star if not for the fact you can work around the problem by unplugging it and plugging it back in to get the fan to turn off and I can live with the noise it makes.
