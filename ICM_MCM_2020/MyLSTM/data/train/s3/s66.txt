I am getting the funny smell on high as others have described.  In addition to the high heat setting possibly being too much for the hardware to handle, it's also hotter than I can handle.    The fan speed and temperature are linked, as there is only one switch.  The low speed is too low, but you have to use high heat to use the higher speed.
