I ordered two of these dryers. I had used them before and I trust their quality. But, when the product arrived, I found that there was no  plug on the end of the cord. These units are made to be hard-wired into the electrical system. I didn't see that clearly spelled out in the descriptive text when I was looking for the product. As such, instead of going thru the hassle of returning both of the dryers I went to Ace Hardware and purchased some plugs to put on the cords. Now I'm just hoping and praying the connections don't heat up and set the house on fire.<br /><br />But the dryers themselves work great!
