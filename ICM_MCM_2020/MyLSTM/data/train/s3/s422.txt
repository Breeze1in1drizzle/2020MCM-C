A little long for the mouth of a baby under six months. My baby was fine chewing on the end of these, but if she tried to suck on it, it would reach all the way back into her mouth and choke her. And she is a big girl! (9 lb 3 oz at birth)  I think they need to change the age suggestion up a year or so.
