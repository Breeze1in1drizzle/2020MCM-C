I think these are adorable!  And such a great idea!  I got especially excited that they offered a dragon version, but although my daughter uses Avent Soothie pacifiers, for whatever reason she just did not take to this pacifier.  Every time she put it in her mouth she would just spit it out.  I couldn't figure out the reason!  But I will definitely try one of these on the next baby and see if it works.
