The John Frieda JF1 hair dryer is a lightweight hair dryer with a sleek design and ceramic heat technology.  Unfortunately, the concentrator has a tendency to get hair stuck in the space in between the concentrator and the barrel of the dryer, then pull hair out.  While it does dry pretty quickly, there isn't a noticeable difference in how shiny or voluminous it makes hair look.  It's also pretty loud.<br /><br />The buttons could use re-working as well, and would be better as switches, rather than buttons.  The temperature and speed buttons are prone to being switched on accidentally.  On the plus side, the hinged filter makes it easy to clean and the cord is a generous length (~8 feet).<br /><br />Overall, the John Frieda JF1 isn't an overly impressive hair dryer and I wouldn't recommend it for the price.
