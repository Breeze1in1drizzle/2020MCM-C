I bought a second monkey wubbanub after a friend gave me one we loved. Sadly, the new one I bought was neither the same size nor plushness as the first. My guess is it's due to manufacturer or production time differences, but the new one was about 30% smaller in length and stuffing. The fabric was also inferior. The pacifier was the same, though.
