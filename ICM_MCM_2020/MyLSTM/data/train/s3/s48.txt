I purchased this dryer for traveling after reading some of the reviews.  I thought the retractable cord would allow more room in my carry on bag too.  I did not use the dryer so I can't review how well it works.  The size even with the cord retracted was my problem; it was as large as my 'home' hair dryer & that is why I returned it.
