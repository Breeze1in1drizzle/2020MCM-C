I didn't realize the difference between the 0-3 month and 3 month+ pacifiers.  They looked the same to me!  Then, when I came out of my sleep deprived stupor, I figured out why my daughter wouldn't take it.  The plastic is much harder on these, and it pops right out of her mouth.  Even now, at 5 months old she won't take it, or just chews on it like a teething toy. It was a waste of money for us. I don't see a real reason to switch from the infant ones that they gave us in the hospital. I just thought the pink was cuter than the green pacifiers.  Ohwell!  Lesson learned as a FTM. :)
