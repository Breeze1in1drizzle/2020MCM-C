The Samsung Counter Top Grill Microwave contains a lot of features including a soften/melt setting and a grill capability but is probably too large for most countertops, an obvious drawback considering what it is advertised to be for. However, after using this microwave I can say that it works well and, while some its components are plastic, it seems pretty well constructed to me. The grilling feature, (the microwave includes a grill and a setting for accomplishing grilling and the soften/melt feature are nice. I tried the soften/melt feature, for example, and it worked fine. I also think this microwave is attractive so that is not a problem. The only real problem I can see with this microwave is that it is just too large for most countertops. If this is not a problem for you then I recommend this microwave, otherwise, I recommend looking for a smaller microwave.
