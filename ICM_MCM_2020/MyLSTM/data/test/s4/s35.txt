I have used this hairdryer many times in many hotel and have always been pleased.<br />It's comfortable, looks sharp, and has different settings.<br />I bought 1 for each bathroom in my new home - near the beach.  Family and friends will have the<br />convenience of not having to travel with a hairdryer.
