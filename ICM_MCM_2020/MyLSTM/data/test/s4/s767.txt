I like this pacifier because it seems to make all the difference in the ease of breastfeeding. The other pacifiers had that odd shaped &#34;orthodontic&#34; nipple and I honestly think it made my little one confused when using it because she always spit it right out. This one has a rounded &#34;nipple like&#34; shape and she took right to it, and there was no problem with breastfeeding either. The only thing I do not care for is the fact that it sometimes seems to come up over her nose when she is sleeping, which bothered me at first but it doesn't seem to restrict her breathing at all. I was told by a friend to try the gumdrop ones because there is a cutout area for their noses, but she spit those right out as well. This Soothie pacifier seems to be the only one she will take and like.
