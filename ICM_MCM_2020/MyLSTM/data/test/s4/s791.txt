At first I thought a clear pacifier was so fabulous.  No annoying bright colors in any baby pictures!  But finding a dropped pacifier on the floor is a real pain because... they're clear.  They're definitely my sons favorite pacifier but they are also the kind you'll want to strap to your baby so you don't spend time looking on the floor for a dropped paci.
