I was very interested in trying this dryer; it features all the current blow dryer buzzwords - tourmaline, titanium and ceramic - all or severely guaranteed to calm the frizz for people with hair like mine.    My hair is thick, with a wave, and it absolutely mushrooms after blowdrying or in high humidity. It takes forever to dry my hair, so naturally your weary arms tick up the heat factor to get it DRY already, and that in turn ups the frizz factor.    I must say, I was impressed. The dryer features several heat and style settings, so to give an honest portrayal of the results, I kept the heat on the equivalent settings as my usual blow dryer. Then, after a while when my arms would usually get tired, I increased the volume setting.    Unfortunately, with this blow dryer, I wasn't faking the exhaustion in my arms. This isn't the heaviest blow dryer I've ever used, but it's up there! If there was such a thing as getting muscled from using blow dryers, I'd be Ahnold already. I wasn't faking it when I reached the point in the blow drying when my arms were saying, Enough already!    The dryer is more than enough power to accomplish the job. What was interesting was after my hair was dry, it really WAS less frizzy than the same routine done with my usual blower dryer.    The second time I tried it, it was raining out and about a billion percent humidity, the perfect laboratory for determining if all the tourmaline/titanium/ceramic add-ons actually worked to keep hair smooth.    It kind of did. What I can say was my hair frizzed, but it frizzed LESS, and it was much shinier than I've ever seen my hair in humid weather. I guess that's an endorsement, but not enough of one where one might forgo a flat iron to flatten out the kinks.     The dryer comes with a diffuser, which I've always found to be WAY too much work and time (if your arms hurt with regular blow drying, you'll be crippled when you're done using a diffuser on thick hair!)    If you're in the market for a blow dryer, and you have a problem with the frizzes, you might want to give the Remington serious consideration. It did a nice job for me, but the gold standard - not having to use a flat iron - remains elusive, even with this dryer.
