I purchased this for my son about a month ago.  We received a Wabbanub as a gift (a bear) and he liked it. I wanted another so that we could have one at home and one at daycare.  We have not tried other types of pacifiers so I can't compare them, but my son took to the Wabbanub right away (we introduced it around 6 weeks).  He can hold on to the animal part when it's in his mouth and usually manuver it back in when it falls out.  He primarily uses it in the car and at daycare.  My one complaint is about cleaning it. I have been hand washing the pacifier part with dish soap and really hot water. The pacifier does not detach from the animal so I'm not sure how I'll clean that part when it gets really grimy. My niece has a similar pacifier but the stuffed animal and the pacifier come apart.
