This is the only ceramic, ionic blow dryer with a retractable cord that I could find on the market and I am very pleased with it.  My fiance loves it because the cord doesn't get tangled or clutter up the bathroom counter.  I love it because it's a great size and performs well-- drying hair very quickly.  The only reason I hesitated from giving it 5 stars is that it is a bit heavy (because of the ceramic core, I suppose).  Lastly I think the product could be improved with a more ergonomic handle.
