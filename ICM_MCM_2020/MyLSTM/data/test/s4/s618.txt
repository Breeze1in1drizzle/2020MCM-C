To address the leading question:<br /><br />Yes, metal racks. That work, during the use of the microwave function. And the universe does not condense into a singularity and explode. What else from my childhood has changed? Do you no longer have to turn the dial on a phone to make a call? Drop a dime in the slot to call someone from a payphone?<br /><br />Anyway: yes, there are metal racks for the microwave and the other function. Follow the instructions.<br /><br />Here's the skinny:<br /><br />This is more than just a microwave. You can see in the description all of the functions--and they all work pretty close to as they are described.<br /><br />That's the first real issue with the &#34;Smart Oven,&#34; as the box labels it: the descriptions on the webpage here? They're almost as complete as the instruction manual. There's a bit more, but overall I would have liked a bit more in terms of device ideas and how to utilize it. Especially with the concepts/cooking types involved. I think the Slim-Fry concept is great, but I'd like to understand how it's working better so that I can do more than chicken wings and fries.<br /><br />You will also note several comments on the lack of timer. It's true: no &#34;non-cooking timer.&#34;<br /><br />In exchange, though, you can actually generate a crispy crust on that microwave pizza.<br /><br />The drop-down door is nice, but keep it in mind as you handle placement. On a countertop, it drops down flush but this does require that the oven is a little taller than my previous microwave.<br /><br />Functionally, I'd like a better option when using the grill or Slim-Fry settings than letting the grease/food drippings to just drop down onto the turntable. Especially because that thing gets wicked hot (as is reasonable) so you have to wait a while to pull it and clean it.<br /><br />But the functions work well, so that's the main thing.<br /><br />In all...great oven. Not perfect, but I've never met a perfect microwave.
