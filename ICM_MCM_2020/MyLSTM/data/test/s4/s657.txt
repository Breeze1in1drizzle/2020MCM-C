I got to admit that I was kinda reluctant of this product at first, but since it is so cute we couldn't help it. When we got the item we throughly inspected it and it is very well made. The plush part is well sewn with the fillings in several smaller self contained parts (i.e. the leg fillings can't pass on other parts of the body). It is light weight but not too light either, if you put it on the baby's belly it will stay there. The baby can lift it with no problems at all.<br /><br />The Soothie pacifier part is sewn into the plush so it won't come apart. It has a large ring with perforations so choke hazard is really none existent.<br /><br />My only complain (and this is why I didn't give it 5 starts and why I won't get another) is the pacifier part has a very small profile. Description says from 0 to 6 months but the tip does look like a new born Cicco pacifier in size and our baby is more used to the #2 orthopedic (flat) profile... so a bigger option for bigger babies would've been nice.<br /><br />It took our baby like 5 seconds to figure out what it was and she instantly and naturally took it from her belly and self inserted it in her mouth. Eventually when she doesn't want it anymore she takes it off and plays with it, speaks with it... it is very cute indeed.<br /><br />If my baby were smaller (say 1 - 3 months) I'd get at least 3 or 4 more. If they make one with a bigger pacifier tip (or another profile) count me in.
