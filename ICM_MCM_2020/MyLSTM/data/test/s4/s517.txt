I don't really use lots of fancy microwave features... we just set the power and the time and call it good.  This microwave works just great for that (it might also have great features... I just don't know them).<br /><br />Pros: Good price, easy to install, nice lights for stovetop, can be configured to vent or recirculate, looks good.<br /><br />Cons: The fan is less effective than a range hood (which is a given for any over-the-range microwave) and not as quiet as I would hope.<br /><br />Other thoughts: the beep is long, but not much louder than any other microwave... I see a lot of comments about it, but it hasn't bothered us.  Overall, we like this microwave and are happy with the purchase.
