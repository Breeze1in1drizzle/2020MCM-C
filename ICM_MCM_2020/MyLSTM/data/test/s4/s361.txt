The dryer works great. Bought this as a present for my wife. Had a rough time assembling it b/c the screws supplied didn't fit or screw nicely in the holes provided for the base. I quick trip to the hardware store to buy some better fitting screws seemed to do the trick nicely.<br />Other than that everything was as expected.
