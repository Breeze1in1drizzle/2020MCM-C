The product was delivered on time and worked as expected, mostly. The hair drier turns on as soon as you plug it in and I found it impossible to turn it off using the switch on the handle. The switch on the plug adapter did work, and perhaps is sufficient -- but I'd prefer having a switch be able to do what it says.    I needed the product urgently so I do not plan to contact the seller.
