I like this hairdryer a lot. Even with the heaviness, which I associate with quality for some reason. It's a comfortable dryer and feels good in the hand without fatiguing it, despite the weight. In the past, I've had the problem of my long hair getting sucked into the dryer. I did not have that issue with this dryer. The one minor complaint I have is that the hot setting didn't feel as hot as I would have liked. The hot feels like more of a medium setting to me so it look a bit longer than I'm accustomed to to dry my hair. As far as the ceramic/ionic nature of the dryer, I'm not fully sure how this works with a blow dryer since it doesn't actually touch the hair like a flat iron or curling iron. The science has been lost on me.<br /><br />This comes with a spot dryer attachment and a diffuser attachment but I don't normally use those.<br /><br />Overall a great dryer.
