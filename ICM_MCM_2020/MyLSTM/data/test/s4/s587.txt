In our family we mostly use the microwave oven to reheat food: 99% of the time (defrost takes the rest). It does the job well but it lacks one convenient element for that purpose: the start button has no memory. This means that you have to retype the amount of time you want to reheat every time. Our previous one (also a whirlpool, from 20 years ago) remembered the time we put in previously and that was extremely convenient.<br />A more minor issue: the fan and light have two modes (hi/lo) but no separate button for each mode (saves space) so you have to push three times when you use these functions.
