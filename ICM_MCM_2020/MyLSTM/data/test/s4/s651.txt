When I purchased this product, I was expecting to be able to have a couple of clean pacifiers that would be easy to get to, especially while on the go. Well, it does keep the pacifiers clean, but it doesn't stay snapped to the bag or whatever it's attached to. I still have to keep it in the bag so that I don't lose the whole thing. Great idea, good product. Just needs a stronger snap.
