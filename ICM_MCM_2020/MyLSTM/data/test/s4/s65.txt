As its a lot stronger than Conair's hair dryer and can get your hair dry in 15 mins (I have waist length thick wavy hair). Not very heavy (I am a small person and it doesn't feel heavy in my hand). Like all other hair dryers it does dry out your hair and damage it. If you use it on the highest setting and for longer duration like 25 mins, you will not need to straighten your hair too much as this itself would do the job. However, unlike the straightener, this will keep the volume of your hair.
