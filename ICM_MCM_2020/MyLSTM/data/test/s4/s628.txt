My baby is tongue tied and so from reading the reviews, it seem that this pacifier would work best with him.  He does take this pacifier a lot easier than any other pacifier.  However, we soon found out that he just does not like pacifier.  The only bad thing I found from this pacifier is that water will get stuck in it.  So I just make sure to squeeze the nipple part fast and hard a few times after washing and that will help get rid of some water.  It does eventually dry up but this does make me worry about mold and bacteria but because my baby hardly uses it at all, I'm not too concern.
