This is an excellent value.  I've owned several Remington products and have rarely been disappointed.  This is no exception.  It works nearly as well as my very expensive Chi hair dryer, but for a lot less money.  It also comes with attachments, which my expensive on did not.  I wouldn't go so far as to say this is salon quality, but for people who don't want to pay for salon quality equipment, but want to get salon quality results, this will be an excellent addition to their tool set.
