I love this hair dryer; the available speeds and temperatures are perfect and it's the most quiet hair dryer I've ever owned.  The only drawback for me is the placement of the on-off switch; it's located at the very bottom of the handle so I have to use two hands to turn it on or off.  A better design would be to reverse the placement of the buttons so it could be turned on/off easily with my thumb; currently, the speed/temperature button is easily reached with my thumb, but I don't change that very often.  That is the only reason I didn't give it five stars.  Nevertheless, I still highly recommend it and would buy it again.
