These pacifiers are as good as the regular Avent ones, however they do have the little groove on top which will require you or the child turning it around if they are wanting to chew or play with the pacifier at times. The glowing handle is fun for  my 18mth old as it's something to focus on at night. The glow does not last long however, it's very quick to pick up light to when &#34;recharging&#34;.
