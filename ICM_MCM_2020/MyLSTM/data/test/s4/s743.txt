The pacifiers are very similar to the avent soothie.  I bought the puppy one.  I like this product because in the middle of the night when my baby is crying, I can easily find the pacifier because it's attached to the puppy.  It helps a lot from the  pacifier dropping out of my baby's mouth.  I wish it was detachable from the puppy so I can clean it easier.
