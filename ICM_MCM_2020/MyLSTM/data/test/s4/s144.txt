This thing has almost as much hot air as a politician! With adjustable temperature settings, variable wind intensity and an &#34;off&#34; switch, this thing is 20 times more responsive than any political figure currently in office.<br /><br />Temperature variations are modest, little chance of frying your skin. Controls are a little cumbersome/awkward but it works, and I don't usually need to shift around much during drying incidents.<br />Air power is effective, if not stunning. Good for drying hair, not good for blowing large spiders across a tile floor (limited cord reach and range of power). Absolutely terrible for flying kites with small dogs attached.<br /><br />I think maybe I'd enjoy seeing a laser sight attachment so I can focus drying power on specific strands of troublesome hair... but we don't always get everything we want.
