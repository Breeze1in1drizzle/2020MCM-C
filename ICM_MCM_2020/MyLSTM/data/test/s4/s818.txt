I'm so very glad I went with this find over the other competitors pacifier holders..<br />My daughter kept switching which pacifier se liked and it really does hold every pacifier ! It took us a while to find the right one and so that was extremely helpful!<br />The only thing I didn't like was finding out the two strings were connected she would pull in one end and the other end would pop out of her mouth.. It defeated the purpose... Even though her binky was still easy to find and out back in but the same thing would happen every time .  The strings shouldn't e connected and I hope they change the design in the future or at least have longer strings
