I use disposables when I go out with the baby, but still wanted a reusable wet bag to carry baby clothes and burp cloths that get dirty. I bought these Kushies bags because they were the least expensive I could find.    Don't expect a heavy-duty wet bag at this price. But these work nicely for me. The drawstring on the large bag is held closed securely by a plastic grip. I've already machine-washed these bags a few times, and they came out perfect. It also folds up very small, and takes up no room, so it's perfect for storing in a smaller changing kit. I use the little bag for pacifiers, because I don't like them rolling around loose in my bag. I'm planning to get a second set in a different color.
