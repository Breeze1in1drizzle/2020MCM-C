Microwave works great and it is more powerful than we expected.  Keep in mind that we do not cook in it... we only use it to heat up drinks and some leftovers.  We like how easy it is to set time with just the 30 second button or the + button that adds 5 seconds at a time.  The only complain we have is that the door sometimes does not shut.  We need to push it up a little to get it to close.  Other than that, it was a great purchase for us
