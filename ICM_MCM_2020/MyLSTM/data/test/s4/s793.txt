When my daughter was a newborn I tried every kind of binky, including this one, but she just wasn't interested. Now she is 9.5 months and just got her first tooth and while teething I tried all the binkies again and this is the one she chose. I like that the whole thing is silicone because even if she puts it in her mouth wrong she can still chew on it.
