The color is much prettier here on Amazon than in person.  In person it is a much darker red, not as bright and shiny.  The attachments go on hard and the finger diff-user is just so large that it really can't be used effectively.  The back cover comes off for easy cleaning and it does, nicely and the screen is easy to clean.  The angle attachment works good.  For the price, it is a good deal.<br /><br />Still a Great Deal, Love my Hair Dryer.  I didn't use the Diffuser, so I sold it on Ebay and the hair dryer paid for itself  ;-)
