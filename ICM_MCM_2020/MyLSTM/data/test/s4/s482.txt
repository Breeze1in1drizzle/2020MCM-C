Purchased Jan. 2004.  Just stopped working 6/12. (I'm guessing the magnetron blew.) Just past the 7 year warranty for that part, so after researching several other microwave ovens, I will replace with the same model.  I hope they are using the same manufacturing process.  (One problem early on was fixed quickly and with full support of customer service, under warranty.)<br /><br />Pros:<br />I have used this microwave daily, usually several times a day for 8 years.  In contrast to one reviewer, my ceramic turntable is as clean as the day I got it. (Yes, I take it out and clean it whenever it gets a spill, either in the dishwasher or by hand.)  Couple of spots on the inside of the unit.<br />I like the clean appearance of having a unit without any handles on the outside.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not be the roomiest interior.  Listed clearly in the specs.<br />Exhaust fan doesn't seem to do much of anything, but I live in a NYC apt that is not set for external exhausting.  So my installation is a 'recirculating' one.  I'm glad I have a large window right next to my range.<br /><br />N/A:<br />I haven't used the special settings too often, so can't remark on them.
