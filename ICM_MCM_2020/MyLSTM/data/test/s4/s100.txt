I initially purchased this to use as a travel blow dryer (mainly for the gym). It turns out, that it works better than the one I keep at home. I have fairly thick hair, and it's gone from chin length to an inch or so below my shoulders since I bought it.     Pros:  -Dries my hair very quickly  -Retractable cord is awesome (don't need to deal with winding it around the dryer)  -Folding handle is awesome as well (takes up less space when storing)  -Not bulky     Cons:  -Very heavy, and thus not very portable which defeats my intended purpose
