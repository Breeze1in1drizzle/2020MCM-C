I have had multiples of this hair dryer over the past 5 years or so.  It works well - has a reasonable amount of power - and is great for travel, because it is so compact.  That said, I would not give 5 stars, because it ALWAYS goes south and inevitably eventually just loses steam and then dies altogether.  I have found that it can be somewhat inconsistent in power delivery - that appears to be a constant feature of this particular design, for whatever reason.  Still, I like and use these and do recommend them with that caveat.
