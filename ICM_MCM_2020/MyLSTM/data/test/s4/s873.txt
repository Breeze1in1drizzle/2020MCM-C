My newborn likes these best out of the ones we've tried. This shape of nipple is best for breastfeeding babies since they are rounded on both sides rather than the type that are angled on one side, which the lactation consultant told me never to use because they will make baby used to using certain muscles in his mouth and will create an improper latch habit while nursing. The only thing that kept me from rating it 5 stars is that the nipples are a little long for small babies and mine sometimes gags on it.
