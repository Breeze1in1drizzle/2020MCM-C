I bought this after my six month old folded his regular soothie binky in half and shove the whole thing in his mouth.  Scared me half to death.  I didn't want to deny him the only binky he really likes, but I also didn't want him to choke to death in his crib.  So I got this one.  It is solid enough that he can't fold it, and he loves chewing on the sides.  The only problem we have is that for the first month we had it, it was too heavy for him to keep in his mouth.  Eventually, he did get the hang of it, and now it is his favorite.
