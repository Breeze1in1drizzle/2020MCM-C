The hospital sent us home with Nuk brand pacifiers. My daughter prefers them over any other brand. As a young baby she had the options for purple and pink, which was fine, but now we'd like more variety of colors. The dots collection is very cute and we get compliments when they match her outfits. We love Nuk!
