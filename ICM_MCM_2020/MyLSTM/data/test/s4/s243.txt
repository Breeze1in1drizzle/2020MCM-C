Nothing wrong yet, had it for a while. Handle is peeling a bit, some people might care, I don't. I'm spoiled by salon quality dryers so you get what you pay for - wish this was hotter sometimes, wish the peeling didn't happen, but it's not affecting the job it's doing so whatever. It's just a dryer!
