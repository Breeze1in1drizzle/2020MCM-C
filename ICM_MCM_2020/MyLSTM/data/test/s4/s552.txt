Really great microwave. Since living in an apartment in NYC meant small kitchen space, we needed something to fit accordingly. This microwave was the largest smallest microwave! Perfect for our usage - simple, functional and good value. This microwave is rather quiet-- love that the beeping noise ends after a few distinct beeps. My old microwaves beeps forever.<br /><br />Easy setup, easy usage and easy clean up.
