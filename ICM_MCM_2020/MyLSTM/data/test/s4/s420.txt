I bought this as a gift for myself.  I was a wee bit disappointed, as it didn't live-up to the quietness of my past ionic dryer.  It 'blows' hard and is quite noisy relative to it - even on the low blower setting.<br /><br />However, the hand set is comfortable and it does the job with lots of blowing noise.
