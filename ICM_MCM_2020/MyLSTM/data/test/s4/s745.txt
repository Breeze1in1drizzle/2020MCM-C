It is very cute but I don't like the fact you can't separate the pacifier from the animal.  When she spits up, it of course gets on the animal.  I purchased her a paci plushie and I much prefer that because you can use any pacifier and it separates so you can wash them separately.  Someone said they put the wannanub in the washer.  That to me is gross.  WHo wants to wash your childs paci in the same place you wash your dirty socks!
