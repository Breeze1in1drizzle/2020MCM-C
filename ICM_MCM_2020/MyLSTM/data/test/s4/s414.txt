I've used it 3-4 times now and it dries quite quickly. I have hair; locs down the middle of my back and I like that the bonnet is large so that my entire head dries. I tend to either braid or curl my locs and it takes forever to dry them when I set them. But I can sit under this dryer for an huor or less and my hair is fully dry.  I did not give a 5 because one of the casters arrived broken. I haven't had time to make a claim with the company and I probably won't because it's such a pain in the neck. I just chose not to insert the wheels.
