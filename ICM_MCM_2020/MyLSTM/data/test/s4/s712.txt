I wanted to share with everyone how great you are!!! My daughter is a little older than the little ones who you would by this product for.  She is 7months and it is great for her.  Not only will she use the pacifier, but she playes with the kitten.  It keeps her quiet in the car.    I would strongly recommend this product to others.
