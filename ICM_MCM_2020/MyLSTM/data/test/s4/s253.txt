I got this to put in our guest room and then, comparing it to my vintage model, claimed it for myself. I don't know how much &#34;times&#34; have changed since the last time I bought a hairdryer, but I was surprised at its slightly reduced output. It's light, though, which is an improvement, and it's easy to operate, so I like it overall.
