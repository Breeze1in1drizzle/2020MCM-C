I was skeptical about buying such an expensive hair dryer. However, my best friend had one and I tried it on a trip. I thought I liked it but still wasn't sure about spending the money. My stylist let one of the other girls dry my hair one day. She used one when drying my hair. I commented on how soft and smooth my hair was. I usually get my hair flat ironed to get the same effect. She didn't have to. I called my girlfriend to see if her hair dryer was the same brand and it was. So I bought one. I love it and haven't flat ironed my hair yet! The only thing I was dissapointed in was that the warranty doesn't apply to the purchases from Amzon. I just hope it lasts for a long time so I don't feel cheated. Overall I am very impressed. I didn't realize that a hair dryer can make such a difference in your hair. I say go for it!
