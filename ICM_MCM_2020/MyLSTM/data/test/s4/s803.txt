Geez!  This is so ridiculously simple - why didn't I think of it?!<br /><br />Great for attaching teething rings and any type of hanging baby toy that has a ring on it.  Keep in mind, it's not like a pacifier clip that you can literally clip to your baby's outfit.  It has to be snapped onto a carrier handle, car seat/stroller strap, etc.  So if you're carrying your baby around it won't work like the binky clips do.<br /><br />For that reason only, I gave it 4 stars.
