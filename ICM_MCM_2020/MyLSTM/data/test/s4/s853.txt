After a recommendation, I bought 3 wubbanubs.  The caterpillar, the zebra and the pink giraffe.  The zebra's shape makes it easy for my 4 month old to hold onto.  She puts one hand up by the pacifier and wraps the other arm around the body like it is her little buddy. It also makes it easy for her to put the pacifier back into her mouth if she wriggles and it falls out.  I think she only favors this one because she is drawn to the black and white of zebras. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the Soothie pacifier is glued in so it can't be changed and the size of the pacifier is 0-3 months.  My daughter is a preemie with an adjusted age of 7 weeks so physically she can use it for another month or so before I should be putting her on larger pacifiers and then eventually the orthodontic shaped ones.  So it is a shame that she can't use it as she grows because it has become like a little friend to her.
