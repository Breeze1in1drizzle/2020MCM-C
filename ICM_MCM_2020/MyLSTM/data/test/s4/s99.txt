I USED ANOTHER BRAND FOR YEARS...AND I REPLACED THEM EVERY FEW MONTHS...NEVER HELD UP.  I HAVE LIMITED SPACE IN THE BATHROOM AND LOVE THE RETRACTABLE CORD AND FOLDING HANDLE STYLES FOR THAT REASON.  I DISCOVERED THIS ANDIS BRAND VERSION AT A HOTEL (FIVE STAR) AND SEARCHED IT OUT AND FOUND IT AT AMAZON.  I'M VERY HAPPY WITH IT ... IT HAS ALREADY OUTLASTED THE CONAIR VERSIONS...ONLY REASON I DIDN'T GIVE IT FIVE STARS IS FOR A CERAMIC IONIC DRYER...IT LEAVES HAIR QUITE FRIZZY!  IF YOU NEED THE COMPACTEDNESS OF THIS DRYER....IT'S THE BEST ONE AROUND.
