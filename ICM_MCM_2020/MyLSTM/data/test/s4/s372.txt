Aside from being a bit heavy, I love this dryer. To be fair, I had been working with an ancient blow dryer that didn't have ceramic or tourmaline heating plates so of course this would work far better. And I've been using the argon oil that came with it which is a dimethicone-based product... of course my hair would be silkier than when I use my homemade aloe & grape seed oil concoction. So whether its the dryer, the products or the combination- I'm not sure. But in either case I am happy with the results each and every time. (I've used it 4 or 5 times by now.)
