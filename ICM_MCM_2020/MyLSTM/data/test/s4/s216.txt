The vendor sent me the European voltage model at first and almost didn't take it back at first.  When I called back, they not only sent me another one, but two more.  Fortunately, I had the second one, because the first one pooped out after only a year and a half.  I hope that this second one last longer, as it is an expensive blow dryer.  It does a very professional job and was recommended by my hair stylist.
