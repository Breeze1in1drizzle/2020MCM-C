These haven't even delivered yet...but I was given some of these when I had my baby and love love love them.  The only improvement that I could think of is I wish it were easier to attach to a pacifier clip (the strings that clip onto the babe)...it only has those small holes that you can thread through - but still worth it, you just need to make sure your clip has a small loop that can fit through.<br /><br />In other news, the glow lasts all night so when your bub loses his soother he can find it in the night (and so can you).  My baby loves it, and they stay in much better than other binkies because they have a little bulb on the end that make it easy to suck so they don't pop out.
