I purchased this hairdryer after the last one (which was just like this one died.)  I love that it is a wall mount and is out of the way and not a hairdryer laying on the counter.  I also like that it is quieter than most hairdryers.  It is not a &#34;Turbo&#34; type dryer.  I have shorter hair so it is works well but if I had really long hair I might would consider a stronger one.  I also like the night light on it.  It is not a really bright light, but just enough to shed light to walk into the bathroom without bumping into things and not have to turn a light on.
