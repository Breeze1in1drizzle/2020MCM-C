I'm a big fan of these being made from a natural rubber versus synthetic. As a plastics engineer, even though many pacifiers are bpa-free I prefer the natural rubber for my child.<br /><br />My child started using a Dr. Brown's orthodontic pacifier at 3 weeks but was not a big pacifier fan until trying Avent Soothie at 4 weeks. Luckily we had received several as shower gifts. However the course of the next 8 weeks we managed to lose 3!  I also had read about replacing pacis at 6-8 weeks. I would agree with this when they're teething or if they reuse the same one frequently. But if you have enough to rotate than its bit necessary.<br /><br />I ordered these due to low Soothie supply & the age cap of 3 months. I like that these can go to 6 months instead.  My daughter has only tried for 1 day & although not as crazy about this one as the Soothie (they have to work harder because of the thickness & opening inside the paci) she likes it!  If I had started with this over Soothie I think she would have gone right for it.<br /><br />Overall a great product & only gets 4 instead of 5 stars b/c of my daughter's preference for Soothies!
