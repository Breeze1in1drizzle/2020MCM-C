I bought this days before my second son was due. It came the day we had him! I wanted something that was *orthodontic*, and also comparable to the soothie (large base that grazes the nose). My first son was a soothie kid, and we will have the Ortho bill to prove it later on. Since I paid so much for this, I wanted very much for my newborn to take to it. Turns out, he prefers, if at all, the Avent air flow (also available for purchase on Amazon). Truth is, my six-week-old just isn't the pacifier-loving kid my first born was. So, I suppose it would have been good to try two years ago! I would suggest trying this one though (I'm a dental assistant, and would recommend you ALWAYS try the orthodontic pacifier before you pop the soothie in your infants' mouth). $9 or$10 is a small price to pay to avoid thousands of dollars in orthodontic bills in their teenage years! And the facts that this one is all natural and has a large round base that touches the nose, much like the breast does during feeding, are just more reasons to give this pacifier a shot. I gave four stars because I didn't end up getting much use out of my investment.
