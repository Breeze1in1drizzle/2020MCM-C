We received this as a gift from our baby registry.<br />Pros: you can choose time settings- 30, 45 or 60 minutes. I use the 30 minutes because the bottles are usually dry in about 10. The sterilizing takes about 8 minutes. It is really easy to use and looks nice on our kitchen counter. It fits 6 bottles and parts at one time.<br />A major problem is that it leaks...ALOT. After we turn it on, our kitchen counter always has a large puddle of water leaking from the sterilizer. We have tried putting less water and making sure we don't go above the max fill line however it still leaks. It is annoying because it leaves water makes all over our countertop. Leaking aside, we tried the advent sterilizer which doesnt dry the bottles  and decided to keep the brezza because the drying option is so convenient and makes it easy to just take the bottles out and not have to dry them separately.
