My baby enjoyed these very much.  The only pacifier she would take.  I like the clear because it goes with everything.  But it is hard to find sometimes because it doesn't have color.  We wasted precious minutes trying to find it when baby was crying.  I still liked the clear, its unique.  Would buy again!
