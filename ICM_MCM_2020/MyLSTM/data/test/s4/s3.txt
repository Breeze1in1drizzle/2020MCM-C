My hairstylist recommended I buy an ionizer hairdryer because it does not dry out hair as much as others. I invested a couple hours researching on line and reviewing the products here at Amazon. In the end, I selected the Conair Ion Shine because it was 1875 watts, was an ionizer, was priced affordably, and the design seemed good.<br /><br />Now that I have received the item and have had some time to use it, here are my ratings:<br />STORABILITY: 2.5 stars  There is a hanging loop, but  the cord is heavy and awkward. The unit is heavy enough that whatever hook one would hang it from would have to be substantially mounted so it would not pull out of the wall. (Wall mounting is not an option for me). Also, after only two uses, the cord has already begun to twist, which is a negative.<br />VALUE: 4.5 stars  I knew the Amazon price was reasonable, even lower than my local discount stores. After I purchased this item,  I found the same model at BIG LOTS for a dollar more and in different colors.<br />PERFORMANCE:  5 stars  Dries hair quickly without using high heat temps. Unit comes with a few attachments. The diffuser is really large and awkward to store. The unit has a hinged filter that opens easily for cleaning. The removable filter is the standard small piece of material that I have seen in other high-tech fan devices, including the high-end SmartTechnologies Smart Board in my classroom. I'm figuring the filter material is pretty standard. In my previous hair dryer, the fan did not have a removable filter for cleaning; eventually the old fan clogged so horribly (despite my attempts to brush it out)that it slowed down and eventually killed the unit.<br /><br />Other note: If a younger child will be using the unit, she may find the unit feels heavy or hard to hold after a while. I suggest looking for one of the smaller, portable units for tweens.
