I have owned several of these over the years and think they are one of the best dryers I have used. They don't have a lot of bells and whistles (just Hi and Lo settings), but if you want a light and powerful dryer that doesn't take up a lot of room, this is it. Also like the very compact size of this unit (you won't get arm cramps trying to hold this while drying).The wall mount is a nice feature.
