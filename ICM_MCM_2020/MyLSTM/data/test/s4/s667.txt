I am SO glad I had three kids! I had to sell my first born to provide this for my third. My second child went blind when the sun caught the diamond at a strange angle but we are Adjusting well. The baby never cries anymore! Sure his head is buried on his chest due to the weight if the object and when he falls asleep with it in his mouth (on his back-clearly!) it is so weighed down into his mouth it NEVER falls out! He can't even flip over in his sleep thanks to the paci! We have been using this since day one and tomorrow he turns five. Thankful we bought this!
