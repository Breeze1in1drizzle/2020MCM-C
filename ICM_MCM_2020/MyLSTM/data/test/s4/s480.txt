I have been unable to find filters that fit this microwave. I ordered some through Sharp and they didn't fit.  Sharp told me that I would have to get a service man out to install them.  The service man could not install them and he called Sharp and was told that there was a design error and there were no filters available for this model.  Sharp would not reimburse me for the expense of the service call.  Otherwise, it is a great microwave/convection oven.
