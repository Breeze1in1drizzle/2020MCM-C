The paci itself is absolutely fine, but I'm giving it a four star review because of the misleading title.  They don't carry this paci in stores near me and I thought I was receiving a two pack.  I received only one and it would have been nice to know because I could have ordered more at the time.  Now I'll have to reorder and wait.  Someone really needs to stay on top of the listings.  It's very frustrating having to read around everywhere for some info.  That's not my job.
