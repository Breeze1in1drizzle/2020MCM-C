I love the Yellowbird! I have very long hair and it holds up to drying my hair, as other dryers wind up overheating before my hair is dry. Not this one. It is powerful, unlike many other dryers, and I love the Cool setting that is continuous instead of being a cool shot.  I would reccomend this dryer for anyone with thick, long hair.
