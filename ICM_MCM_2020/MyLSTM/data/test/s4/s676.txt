No complaints really about the product.  I would like to see a few things telling me how safe it is-especially since the skull and crossbones glow in the dark!  Would have been happier if cost would have included shipping.  $10 was a bit much for a pacifier, but it was exactly what I wanted so I can't complain too much!
