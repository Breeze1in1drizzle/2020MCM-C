Like others, tommee tippee is the only brand my baby would take...he refused all the others we tried. The only down side of the clear is that it is invisible...nearly impossible to find even in a well lit room and forget about finding it on white sheets. The up side of this is that it looks better in pictures than other pacifiers as he does not look like he has a giant piece of plastic covering half his face.
