This is a fantastic little hair dryer. I bought it two weeks ago after reading the reviews and absolutely all the positive reviews about it are true. I love the power it throws out. It is quick and nice in doing its business. It is a little noisy but I guess that is something which I felt in my previous dryers from other brands too. A point to note however is that though the product description indicates ...and removable concentrator make this a versatile styler..., there is no concentrator that I received in my package. So if you are looking for a hair dryer with a diffuser or concentrator, then this product does not come with one and you may need to search and buy one separately.
