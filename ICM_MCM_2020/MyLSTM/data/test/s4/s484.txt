After reading the specs, my husband measured the height before installing. We replaced the cabinet over the stove to a shorter cabinet (we were remodelling the kitchen), so we have none of the problems with the heat on the latching mechanism other people mentioned.  I love all of the features on this microwave (especially the sensor cooking), it was easy to install, and after 8 years my only complaint is that the LED readout has completely burned out, so my cooking is now by braile.  I was checking Amazon to see how much money to replace this microwave and was really surprised by the reviews.  I will purchase this product again when it finally quits working.
