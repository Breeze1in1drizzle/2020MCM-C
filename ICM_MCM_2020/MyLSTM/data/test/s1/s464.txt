This is built to break.  I have a 5 yr warranty from the dealer, which is fortunate because I am now on my third repair or replace process in 18 months.  For me it has consistently been the essential part of the microwave-the magnetron-which makes it heat!  update Oct 2015:  I bought this in Feb 2013 and the magnetron issue has happened once again, and I don't even use it a lot for actual cooking.   I can get it repaired or replaced because of the warranty, but it is tiresome to go through this so frequently.   The GE model I purchased previously lasted 12 years.  Has a commitment to quality dropped so drastically?  And Bosch is alleged to be one of the better brands.     Buyer Beware!
