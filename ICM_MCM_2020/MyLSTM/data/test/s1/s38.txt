Well I had to put a 1 star on this because of the seller.  I hate to give the blow dryer a bad rating but I have no way to rate the seller any longer and I NEED you all to see this review!  This is my second Elchim dryer and my first one is still going strong after 7 years.  The one I purchased only 5 months ago from this seller, stopped blowing hot hair and according to Elchim...there is not much help because Amazon is not an authorized seller of Elchim.  I contacted this particular seller with no response (big surprise) and noticed just today that they changed their &#34;business&#34; name.  I noticed amongst the reviews that I am not the first situation like this.  The Elchim rep told me it is possible these are either not authentic Elchim dryers or they could possibly be selling them as refurbished.  I will have to pay to ship the dryer to Elchim so they can determine.  I will be doing this since I spent over $80 bucks on the dryer.  In a nutshell, save yourself from any hassles IF the dryer goes bad and buy directly from an authorized Elchim seller.
