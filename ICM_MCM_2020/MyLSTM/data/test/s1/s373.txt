When I first received this I absolutely loved it.  Great power, the cord was sturdy and extra long, and it worked really well.  However, I am returning it for a refund, because one month after getting it, the &#34;hi - lo&#34; switch stopped working and it would only work on &#34;high&#34;.  I thought I could live with that but this morning when I was using it the switch in the handle started feeling really hot and smoke started coming out of it.  So I don't know if it was just a fluke and this particular one was defective, or if it is something that happens often with this model.  I was really disappointed though because I was really pleased with it when it was working as it was supposed to.
