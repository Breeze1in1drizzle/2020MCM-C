Evidently this is a common problem with Samsung microwaves: the keypad shorted out after less than two years of use, resulting in the microwave, stove light, and exhaust fan becoming inoperable.  The cost of repair- for labor only- would have been $150 for an item that originally cost $220.  After several calls to Samsung's Executive Customer Relations department, I was curtly informed that Samsung is unwilling to take ANY action to remedy this situation.  My only option at this point is to replace the microwave - NOT with a Samsung product- as I have no way of running the exhaust fan in my newly-remodeled kitchen. And even worse, due to some new environmental law, I will have to PAY to dispose of this worthless piece of junk.<br /><br />Samsung does not stand behind the products they sell. Samsung has atrocious customer service.  Across the board their products get poor reviews, yet they are unwilling to take any action to correct the problem and maintain good customer relations. They appear to operate under the assumption that  for every dissatisfied customer, there are thousands more willing to buy their shoddy crap. This attitude is unacceptable, especially in these tough economic times.<br /><br /> I will NEVER buy ANY Samsung product, EVER!  Save yourself the aggravation:  DO NOT BUY!
