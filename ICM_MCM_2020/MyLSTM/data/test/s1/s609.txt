I received a Danby Microwave for Christmas 2011.  Less than 4 months later it stop working  I called the Danby 800# and was told what to do.  I did this and have not heard anything back.  I have attempted numerous times with no success on getting my refund.  Loss to my family of $85.00<br /><br />I will never buy another Danby product or recommend one.
