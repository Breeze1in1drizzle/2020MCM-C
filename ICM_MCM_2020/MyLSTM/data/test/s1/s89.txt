I was very disappointed with this dryer.  It essentially was a hand-held dryer with a hanger.  The hanger was completely independent of the dryer.  I thought the hanger would have a plug, but no, the dryer had the plug and a very long cord.  I thought the hanger would turn the dryer off when the dryer was placed in the hanger--no, you just turned the dryer off as you would any hand held.  Save your money and buy a hook to hang your dryer on.
