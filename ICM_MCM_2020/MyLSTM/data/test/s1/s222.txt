I also ordered the Silver Bird 2000W Turbo Hair Dryer at the end of January 2012 but was sent a Black Bird 2000W Hair Dryer instead. It was obvious someone stuck the Black Bird hair dryer in a plastic bag that was sealed with regular Scotch tape and had a small label with a bar code and a description for the Silver Bird dryer.  As soon as I received it, I contacted Amazon's Customer Service via an online chat and told them they sent me the wrong item. I was sent a link for a UPS return label, which I printed out. I asked the rep if they could arrange for UPS to pick the package up since I live in a very rural area, and they were responsible for the fulfillment and shipping of the product. I was told that I would have to find a UPS drop-off point myself. (It was very frustrating dealing with the online chat rep.)  I tracked the return of the package to Amazon and waited for my refund. Six business days AFTER they received the hair dryer, I still didn't see a refund to my credit card.  This time I checked the box asking for one of Amazon's Customer Service reps to call me, which they did, immediately. This time, my experience with Customer Service rep #2 was excellent. The gentleman who helped me out was a true pro. He researched my transaction and issued a credit to my account, which hit the next day. I would never order anything from NewVo Beauty again. Fortunately, I received excellent service from Amazon's telephone reps. Beware of NewVo Beauty. I don't believe their outstanding ratings, either.
