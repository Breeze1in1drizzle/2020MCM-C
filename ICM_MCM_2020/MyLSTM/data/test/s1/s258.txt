I ordered this hair dryer to use for travel. The first time I used it, it caught on fire!  The manufacturer reluctantly exchanged it for a new hair dryer because it was after the return parameters. Really?  It caught on fire!  The replacement went on a trip to Europe with me and the VERY FIRST TIME I attempted to use it, it AGAIN CAUGHT ON FIRE! I'm lucky it didn't catch my hair on fire...and the worst that happened was a burn hole in the hotel towel!  Very scary.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
