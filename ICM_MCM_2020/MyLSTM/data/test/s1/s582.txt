Have had this microwave for just a year and it has stopped working. The &#34;door&#34; signal comes on when I push the start button, even though the door is properly closed and it won't start. Very disappointed in the quality of this product. Pathetic that it stops working after only a tear of light use. Anyone else have this problem?
