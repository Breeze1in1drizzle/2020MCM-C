This came with the townhouse I bought in May 2013. It is now Jan. 2014 and it's dead. The date of manufacture is July 2011. Came on here to buy another and read all the reviews....THANK you ...now I know to replace it with a different brand. It's not even 2 years old. Unfortunately, the previous owners bought the whole shebang so I own the same brand/model oven, fridge and dishwasher...AHHHHH....that doesn't bode well for me, does it? Hopefully the microwave is the worst of them and I'll get more use out of the rest of them. Frigidaire is an Electrolux company. Thanks again for the reviews.<br />Beth
