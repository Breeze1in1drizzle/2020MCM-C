This was a reeplacement purchase.  Our previous unit had no issues and was locally purchased.  The door was accidentally damaged and could not be easily repaired.  Needed exact replacement for previously purchased trim kit although product reviews concerning.  Within 2 weeks the electronic key board routinely malfunctioned.  Often requires multiple attempts to start.  contacted seller who defered back to GE.  Not the kind of service I expected nor previously experienced with an amazon vendor.  My recommendation is to avoid both (vendor and product)if possible.
