This is a hilarious and adorable pacifier, there's no doubt, BUT IT IS A HUGE SAFETY RISK!!<br />We have only had ours a month and when I was washing it in the sink the nipple came detached from the base. If this had happened in my wee ones mouth he could have sucked it back and choked!!<br />Buyers be wary! There's no way the cute photo will be worth your kid's safety
