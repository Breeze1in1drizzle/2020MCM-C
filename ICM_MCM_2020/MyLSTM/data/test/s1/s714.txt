The pacifiers sent are not the pacifiers pictured. These are a different name, made in another country and the wrong size. Customer service could not be made to understand that just because an item is made by the same company it is not the same item. Different markets have different items/sizes.  Bottom line is you no longer carry a staple item I purchase regularly for my 2 kids. I can not be sure you will not send me the wrong item again so I am buying from another source now.
