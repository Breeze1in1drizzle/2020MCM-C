My Whirlpool microwave, 18 months old, caught on fire. I tried calling Whirlpool once and was told I would get a call back from someone in safety. Never happened. I called back, sat on hold for 35 minutes, then had a customer service rep hang up on me. WHIRLPOOL NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS FAULTY PRODUCT. THIS KIND OF PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOT OK. No one buy this product :Whirlpool WMC20005YW: it is a safety hazard!!!!!!!!!
