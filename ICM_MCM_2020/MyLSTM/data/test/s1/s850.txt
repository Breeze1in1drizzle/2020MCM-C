Warning! This is a novelty item only.  I bought this one because it's advertised as AVENT and it is, however, it is a piece of black plastic cut out in the shape of a mustache hot glued on to an AVENT pacifier. This CANNOT be boiled to be sanitized or it will fall apart which is not in the listing at all.  Suddenly I wish I had purchased one of the cheaper and sanitizer friendly alternatives that I saw.
