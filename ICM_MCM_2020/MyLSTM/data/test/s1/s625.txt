The handle is attached to the door by two weak screws that bear up against a nonmetallic surface on the door. For my unit, the lower attachment door surface broke within six months and the handle pulled away from the door.<br />I am having a service call take care of it but it looks like a design flaw. Even if I get a replacement door, I expect it will break again in six months. Avoid this model design.<br />Updated Dec 2016: Yes the replacement door also is showing the same problem.<br />Worse: The magnetron failed as soon as the one year warranty was up. Would not heat food. We had a service call and replaced it.<br />It has failed again in 9 months. LG wants more for a service call than the new microwave cost.<br />I would avoid LG microwaves completely. I still have a countertop Panasonic microwave working perfectly after 15 years - unfortunately LG does not know microwaves :)
