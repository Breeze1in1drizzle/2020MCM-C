Please do not waste your money like I did. It lasted me exactly  3 minutes. First it heated up and turned off automatically within a minute or so. I restarted it, but it immediately turned off again and this time for good. I tried to return it for a refund, but the status kept reading : we are waiting for your return or something similar. It is not the end of the world, but I certainly am a very unhappy customer.
