My 5 week old does not like any pacifiers, and he does not like these either. I think that the shape and feel of the plastic is too different from what he prefers most: the breast. He seems to have trouble forming suction in the way that you do while breast feeding. Like most traditional pacifiers, there is a ninety degree angle/ perpendicular junction between the hard plastic outside shell and inner soft plastic piece that goes in the mouth. This composition makes it difficult for him to latch on as it is so different from how one latches onto the breast. Anyway, I suspect that if your baby generally likes pacifiers, they will probably like these. But if they are choosy and/or exclusively breast fed, they may not like these. therefore, you may want to think twice if you're purchasing or registering for these for a baby that hasn't arrived yet, or until you have a better sense of their preferences.
