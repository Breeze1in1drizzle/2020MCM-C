Cooling fan vents out of the front of unit.  Only vent fan opens exhaust louver.  Vent fan is manual only unlike implied in user guide.  If manual vent not operated in conjunction with any cooking then possibility exists of damaging cabinets.  Strongly recommend getting a normal exhaust / vent fan and a countertop microwave.
