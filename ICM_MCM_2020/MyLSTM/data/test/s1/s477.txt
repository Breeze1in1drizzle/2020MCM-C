18 month old microwave will not stop running until unplugged, which is a complete fire hazard and deemed unsafe.  I will never purchase a Frigidaire product in my lifetime again, or recommend it to anyone.  This is not the first 18 month old Frigidaire product I will have to replace.  STOP NOW if you are considering this product brand!!!
