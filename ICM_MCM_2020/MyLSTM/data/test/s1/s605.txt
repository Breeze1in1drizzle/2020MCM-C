In my kitchen there is a wall directly to the left of the microwave space. The microwave I had before, a GE, worked fine, but the Whirlpool is hinged differently so that there needs to be more clearance to the left. I guess it is expected there are shallow cabinets on each side but in my case there's a wall so since the Whirlpool is hinged so the door requires more clearance, it does not fit. Nowhere in the specifications did I see that it requires more than an inch clearance to the left and cannot be installed with a wall to the left!
