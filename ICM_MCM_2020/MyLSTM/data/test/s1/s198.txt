This dryer blows nicely, but does not get hot enough to dry hair quickly. It takes a really long time to dry hair, and it comes up frizzy due to drying it with low heat. I waited too long to return it, so am stuck with it.Going to use it to dry my dogs hair after bathing. Be sure to return within the given time period if you find it does not get hot enough. Mine may be defective.
