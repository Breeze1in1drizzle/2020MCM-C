My son could not latch onto this without my finger in it. Not sure if that's how it's supposed to work but makes it pretty useless. He latches onto other pacifiers like a pro. Also, the few times he was able to latch for a few seconds, it looked so creepy - like silence of the lambs or something - because you just see through the hole into his mouth as he sucks in. Hard to explain but just not for us.
