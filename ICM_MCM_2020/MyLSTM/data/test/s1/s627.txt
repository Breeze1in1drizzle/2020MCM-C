This was bought as an emergency replacement for a wonderful Sharp combo oven.  The convection circulating fan had failed, and there was no time to have it repaired.  The fan motor simply needed to be replaced.  The microwave function still worked perfectly, but I needed the convection oven for holiday baking.  It was just before Thanksgiving and I couldn't find a replacement of the the Sharp locally, and no time for an on-line order.<br /><br />I found this Samsung locally, and it looked like it would fill the bill.  It did save me from holiday disaster, but I've been far from pleased with it.  You have to memorize ridiculous sequences of the controls that offer you only numbers as feedback so the manual near at hand is essential.  It will only accept two entries for sequence cooking; I used three much of the time in the Sharp for extraordinary results cooking rice and polenta.  Now I have to enter the first two stages, then the third after the first two are finished.<br /><br />The temperature of the convection mode is incredibly erratic; I set 200 degrees and when I checked the oven temperature during cooking it was at 350.  Today I set it at 400 (the maximum) and it never got above 350.  I think the control circuit board is failing because I looked at the clock when it was 6:12 and the oven clock read 10:something.  I reset the clock, then looked at it this evening at around 8:30 and it read 1:something.<br /><br />The only good thing about the appliance is that the beeper can be shut off.  (I hate those electronic beeps.)  As far as I'm concerned Samsung should stick to making phones and not try to produce products they don't have enough concern about to do well.  I will avoid the brand for appliances.
