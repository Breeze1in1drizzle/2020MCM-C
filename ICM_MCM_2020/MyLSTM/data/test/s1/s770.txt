I bought these pacifiers because of other reviews that their babies liked the pacifier, and they were breast fed babies. My son did not like these wish i would not have purchased them. I do like the design better that the ones that you get at the hospital. My son will suck on the mam pacifiers for a while. I think it is because these have nothing for him to get latched onto and the mam pacifier kinda bows out to the sides.
