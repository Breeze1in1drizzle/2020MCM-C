After only two years of owning this microwave it started arcing when started. I looked into replacing the HV Diode and the HV Capacitor but those parts were damaged because the magnetron went bad. It was cheaper to replace the whole microwave than order parts and fix myself. Truly disappointed in Whirlpool and their products. The matching Whirlpool gold french door fridge we bought at the same time just had almost $1,000 worth of repairs. After only two years!!! These are cheaply made disposable pieces of garbage.
