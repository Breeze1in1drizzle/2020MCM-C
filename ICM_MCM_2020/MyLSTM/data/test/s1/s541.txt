Like most other reviews here, I can confirm that this microwave died quickly. After 2 weeks the handle broke off in my wifes hand. After 10 months we had a loose connection internally that needed to be repaired, and now after 16 months, the unit is completely dead. Fuses all check out fine. Thermal fuse, Thermocouple and power check out fine. All 120 volts. Either the control board for the keypad is dead, or the magnatron, HV capacitor or diode is shot. Either way, we are NOT repairing the unit again. It will be replaced with a commercial microwave and I will build a shelf for it to sit on over the top of our range. I will mount an exhaust fan below that and duct it all outside.<br /><br />This microwave has completely turned me off from the Samsung brand (which all of our appliances are). Too bad it's just cheap construction that ruins these new microwaves. They are all built with cheap components, unless you buy a commercial/industrial unit.<br /><br />Look at the Panasonic Pro series NE-1054, Vollrath 40830, Turbo Air TMW-1100M, or Amana RMS-10D for quality at a decent price. I wish they made a commercial over the range style, but I have yet to find one.
