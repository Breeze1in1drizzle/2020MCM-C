This seems like such a good idea, but my daughter hated these pacifiers. They were always snapping shut on her, and the closures seemed to press into her face and not be comfortable. I offered them over and over, but finally gave up. I found one in the car months later that I'd left there for an emergency, and I offered it again, but she still couldn't keep it in her mouth.
