I bought this hair dryer based on all the glowing reviews I read about it.  So of course when it arrived, I was excited to see just how fabulous a job it was going to do drying my hair.    Okay for starters, this thing has 2 settings:  slow and hot, fast and heat-of-a-thousand-suns hot.  The setting that this dryer has for low on the heat side would be about as hot I would normally dry my hair...but since there's no speed setting to choose from, I'd be in the bathroom for about an hour trying to get my hair dry.    The thing is a little clumsy to hold and the nozzle is just slightly bigger than a silver dollar so there's not even a LOT of air coming out of it.    I turned it on, used it for about 2 minutes, repacked it into the box and came out here to immediately begin the return process.    Save your money.  This thing isn't the savior of hair care products like other reviews would lead you to believe.  It's overpriced for what you get and not impressive at all.
