To be fair, I cannot actually review the dryer itself. I received the dryer with the diffuser attachment missing, which renders it pretty much useless for me. I also received a black & purple dryer, which is not a big deal, but receiving an item that does not include attachments included in the description & a different color when it was not stated that colors may vary, makes me wonder whats happening in quality control. Frustrating.
