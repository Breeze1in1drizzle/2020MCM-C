We purchases this microwave in April 2014, loved the drawer/cupboard installation.  July 2, 2014 we woke up to a very bad burning odor from the microwave, it was nit in use.  We contacted Sharp and they scheduled a service company to have a look at it.  It will be 5 weeks this Sat. & we still do not have a microwave.  We have been informed now by Sharp after two service calls that our microwave need to be picked up and taken off site to be tested.<br />I would never purchase this microwave again and wished I had read the reviews prior to purchasing it.  The burning odor is obviously a problem now that I read the reviews.
