We have owned two of these hair dryers and each of them functioned for just over a year (coincidentally, a few months past the return window).  We loved the fact that these fit nicely on the wall, are easy to access and keep the bathroom organized.  However, both hair dryers shorted out and you could see sparks inside the barrell when turned on.  The second one had smoke rising from it and continued to emit noises after we unplugged it.  These hairdryers were only lightly used by adults and were not dropped or mishandled.  The first time it happened, we figured it was just bad luck, but not the 2nd time.  There are several other reviews for hairdryers from this company that report similar malfunctions.  We won't be buying a 3rd time and will try another wall mount brand that hopefully isn't as hazardous.
