I should start by stating my wife was the one that used this dryer so the report of how well it worked is indirect. We gave it 1 star because I couldn't give 0 stars. Don't get me wrong. The dryer worked great for 3 months. Then, the motor went out. The honeymoon was over. The box states it has a 24 month manufacturers warranty. They will replace, but it costs money. For me it was $40 plus another $15 to ship. Absurd! They said even doing so was against their rules because Amazon was not an authorized dealer. Well, long story short, the manufacturer (T3) wanted $55 to replace. Amazon, knowing this is a poor business practice, stood behind their service and refunded the entire purchase price. To summarize, I wouldn't buy anything this manufacturer peddles and I hope you don't either.
