I bought this dryer expected outstanding results.  It performs no better than any hairdryer I have had.. Matter of fact, maybe not as good...It does not have the blowing power that my   Revlon has, and is not any lighter.  I don't know what all the hype is about this one...Save your money and get a $30 one..I found out they are just as good.
