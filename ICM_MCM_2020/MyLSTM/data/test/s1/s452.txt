Late last year we remodeled our kitchen. We put in top of the line Wolf/Sub Zero appliances that we always wanted, but we let our salesperson talk us into this Sharp microwave. This microwave hasn't even been in a year and the door is already separating from the glass (hard to understand since it is the one appliance that we rarely use-I am in a rigorous school program and my husband travels for work). I can almost fit my pinky finger into the gap that has formed between the door and the glass. The microwave is used maybe once a week for a reheat after a late shift. When I called Sharp about this issue, I was transferred to every department until finally the one I needed was closed. Yep transferred to different departments only to be told that they couldn't help and the one that could help me was closed for the evening. I called at 1pm MST. This is so frustrating to have my beautiful dream kitchen with this eyesore coming apart...who knows how they will have to rip it out. I am off to buy a Wolf drawer microwave; their helpful customer service goes out of their way to make sure you are satisfied.
