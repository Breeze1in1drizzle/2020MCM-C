I have made the mistake of buying two GE space saver microwaves for my two homes. Both have badly peeling paint not only inside the door but on the back wall of the microwave as well. Got same answer form GE.buy the paint and paint it myself.  Did buy the paint but by then the rust was too extensive to nake it work. I am also looking for a nice microwave about the same size and features!
