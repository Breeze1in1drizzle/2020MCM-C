I bought this dryer because I wanted to deep condition my hair and also do roller sets (for reference I have hair to my tail bone with curly 3c type texture). Anyways¡­ This dryer didnt even work!! I opened the package and all the parts were there. I put it together according to the instructions¡­. but then when I plugged it in and turned it on, NOTHING happened. The timer worked (it sounds like a cooking timer), but nothing else did. There was no air flow, no power light- NOTHING!!!<br /><br />I will be returning this, but I am yet to hear from the seller (this just happened today). I will come back on here to write an update and let you ladies know how/if they resolve the issue. I expect I will have to pay return shipping- but thats not fair given that I was shipped a defective item! (If I do- I will leave negative feedback).<br /><br />Overall the appearance of this dryer was &#34;cheap&#34;. The stickers surrounding the dials were peeling off once I opened the box, and the dryer hood wasn't very sturdy on the pole. Don't get me wrong- I wasn't expecting this to be a &#34;Mr. Pibbs&#34; by any means, but good grief- I at least expected it to turn on!! I must've gotten a bad dryer b/c the other reviews on here are decent (hence my deciding to purchase one). But ladies take my advice¡­. if you want a &#34;risk free&#34; piece of equipment then just save up and get a Mr. Pibbs. Otherwise you run the risk of being in my situation with a bum dryer and the possibility of having to pay return.
