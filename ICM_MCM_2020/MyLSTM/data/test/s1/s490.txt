I absolutely cannot believe the experience we have had with this microwave model!!!  Take it off the freaking shelves already. RECALL IT.  The same issue over and over again - all within 6 to 8 months for each one that was replaced!  The unit just explodes with a horrible electric cracking sound while it is running.  There is an electrical short that fries the insides.  3 microwaves later, here we are once again calling the warranty man.  DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL!
