Seems great at first, but it's not great for long hair unless your unnaturally careful while using it. It's always a possibility that long hair can get sucked into the back end of a hair dryer, but because of the extremely small size, it happens extremely easily with this one. Especially if you flip your head upside down to dry it, you lose even more control. The first time it sucked some hair up, it lost significant drying force. The second time, it stopped working altogether. Not to mention the hair loss. It is, however, without a doubt, the most adorable hair dryer I've ever seen.
