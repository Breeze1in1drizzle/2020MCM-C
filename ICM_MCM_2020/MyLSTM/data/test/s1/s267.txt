The Hot Tools Salon Dryer does not have enough power to actually dry your hair.  The dome doesn't fit around your head (or my head) like it does at the salon. The combination of the size of the device as well as the lack of heat that it blows out, make this a bad purchase. I do not recommend and I will be returning it.
