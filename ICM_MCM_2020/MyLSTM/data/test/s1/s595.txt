2 days after we had it installed it stopped heating food. During first service call we were told to unplug it and to let it reset. It still wasn't working. In the second service call we were instructed to turn the vent fan on manually when using the range top due to the microwave shutting down to avoid over-heating.  We immediately noticed that from that point on the microwave would not heat food unless the vent fan was running. (even if the stove was off and cold)  After the next service call, the microwave still wasn't heating food without the vent fan running despite the technician replacing a part and the microwave vibrating and humming whenever the vent fan was on after his repair.  We scheduled another service call.  The technician did not visit, stating that he had ordered a part that would solve the problem.  That was on May 15, 2014... it is now June 17th and we still don't have a working microwave. Disappointing for a $400 investment.<br /><br />Why:<br />I've ALWAYS recommended Samsung televisions and blue-ray players because they were excellent products with great features and no problems since 2009. The microwave I bought never worked properly and after 5 months and several service calls, it still does not work.  I'm afraid to spend any significant amount of money on a Samsung product if this is how defective merchandise is handled.<br /><br />UPDATE: October 25, 2014<br />After 7 months, countless hours on the phone with Samsung's customer service and about 7 to 9 service calls... we went back to Lowe's Home Improvement (we should have in the first place) and they IMMEDIATELY replaced it with a Whirlpool.<br /><br />I liked my Samsung Flat-screen TV so much that I was going replace my other 2 TVs with Samsungs. Their exceedingly poor service and support make it an absolute certainty that I will not buy a big-ticket item from them. On the off chance that you get a defective item, they will not make it right for you.
