i bought this product thinking my 10 week old son would enjoy it. I set him in the bouncy chair and let the bear sit on his lap with it turned on. I was watching him and realized the fur was covering his hands. It wouldn't come off so I had to actually run his hands under water and I had to scrape his tounge off since he had it all in his mouth from his hands. I would think for the price that he material would be better and not just falling out and everywhere! Seriously though, the fur is a huge choking hazard!!
