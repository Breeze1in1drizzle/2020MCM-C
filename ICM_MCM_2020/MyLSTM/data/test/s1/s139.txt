I bought this hair dryer with high hopes that it would be the dryer of my dreams!  Not so.  I used it for about a month, trying to like it.  It was quiet and light weight, but didn't dry my hair in half the time of my cheap dryer like everyone states it should.  It took about the same amount of time due to the fact that it doesn't have much blowing power.  It's like my old hair dryer on low!  I hated it so much I sold it on ebay and bought an Elchim 2100.  Now, that dryer really BLOWS!  It's also a whole lot less expensive and supposed to last for 2000 hours of use.  At 5 minutes of use per day (yes, it's that fast), that's 65 years!
