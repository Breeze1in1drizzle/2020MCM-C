I feel that there is a design flaw in this product. The SENSOR REHEAT button it just below the STOP CLEAR button and very easy to push by mistake. This very thing happened to our Microwave oven on January 27 2008, after a few minutes we could smell burning plastic, I ran into the kitchen and found the microwave smoking and after unplugging the unit I found that the door seal had a melted hole in it. I feel that an automatic feature like SENSOR REHEAT should not be an AUTO DESTRUCT! This could have become a very serious situation by starting a fire or having melted plastic stick to someone. I did not have the original receipt because it was a gift in 2007 and it is not worth paying the shipping charge to send it back, I wanted to inform you of this dangerous condition. We have replaced the microwave with another Sharp R402JK without the SENSOR cook, we have always liked sharp products and it is sad that this unit failed to live up to the Sharp reputation From Sharp Minds come Sharp Products  Sharp refused to honor the warranty saying that it was a consumer fault  by running the microwave with nothing in it. I feel this is a very dangerous flaw, you can just lean against the control panel and the unit will start up and run untill it melts.
