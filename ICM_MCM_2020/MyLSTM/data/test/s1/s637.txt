I finally broke down and opened this shower gift after my in-laws kept complaining that I was serving the milk to cold.  Either the bottle is still too cold, or I have had several bottles where it has heated them so that the milk burned my hand.  I am glad I did not believe the product information about no hot spots and tested the bottles first!  I only wish I had saved the packaging and got my money back.  Save your money, a cup of hot water works fine and my daughter does not mind if it is slightly cold.
