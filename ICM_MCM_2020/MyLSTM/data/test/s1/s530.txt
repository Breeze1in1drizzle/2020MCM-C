We purchased our Samsung MW (SMH9187W)three years ago.  It now has an SE error.  As others reported, Samsung told us to flip the breaker switch, etc., but a few minutes later, the same SE message came up, along with incessant beeping. Called Samsung back and we were passed around for about half an hour.  Called Lowe's (where we bought it) - said it would probably cost $150 to fix it and it should have lasted five years.  To us, not worth fixing.  Will NEVER buy another Samsung appliance.
