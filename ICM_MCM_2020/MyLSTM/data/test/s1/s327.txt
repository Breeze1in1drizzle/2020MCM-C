I just opened up my package which I was very excited about because of the reviews I read. Well, once I opened it I found someone's hair all in the box and sticking to the plug stickers on the hair dryer. Also, there were scratches and dings all over the hair dryer. This was 100% used. I am totally grossed out that someone else's hair was all over a product that I paid good money for. When someone returns something it is not right to resell it so someone else. UPS is coming to pick it back up tomorrow and I am assuming I'll be getting a refund or at least I better. I am extremely disappointed and have never had this happen before using Amazon. Either way, I will not be buying from this seller anymore!
