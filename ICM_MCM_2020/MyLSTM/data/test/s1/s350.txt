Started making strange noises and burnt out just a few months after purchase (we bought it in April, it's now September). Pro Beauty Tools offers an exchange but you have to pay to ship the damaged item to them AND pay a return shipping & handling fee. And from the other reviews here I expect another one would likely just burn out again in a few months... would have been nice otherwise.
