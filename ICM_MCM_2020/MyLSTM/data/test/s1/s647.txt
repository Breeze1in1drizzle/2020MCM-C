When I received the package, it was neither wrapped in the original packaging nor wrapped in plastic. It was in a shipping envelope, no shipping popcorn, no shipping bubble wrap, nothing. After viewing the pacifier, it appeared as if it were used. There were scuff marks that clearly could not have come from the shipping envelope. I threw it in the trash immediately. Even if it were in plastic (not the original packaging), I would have tossed it. There's no way in the world I would have put this used looking pacifier in my babys' mouth.
