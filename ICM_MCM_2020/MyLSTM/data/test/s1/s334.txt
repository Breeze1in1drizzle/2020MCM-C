I purchased this item last year and used it once. It worked very well. However, I became pregnant and didn't have time to focus on my hair. When I went back to use it again earlier this year, it toppled over and the legs on the base broke. I tried gluing it together but it didn't work. I am disappointed because I was hoping to be able to use this for a while but I guess not.<br /><br />The top is definitely WAY too heavy for the base it comes with. Hoping I can find something that will suffice or buy a replacement base. Otherwise, that's $104 down the drain. Not cool...
