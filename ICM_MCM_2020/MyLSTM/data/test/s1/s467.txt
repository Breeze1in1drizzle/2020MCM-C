My wife called them and asked if they had a little time bomb inside.  How else could the thing die right on time.  The oven made the sound of shorting electricity, gave off a few whiffs of ozone, and that was it.  The young girl at the other end of the call said that they may be able to look into getting us a new part, but we would have to pay for labor.  I'm not going to throw good money after bad.  I'm just not going to buy Frigidaire items anymore.<br /><br />We have purchased the Gallery Stove and Oven (which we absolutely love) and then we purchased the Gallery Microwave (which died), and we purchased the Gallery Dishwasher (which doesn't wash dishes).  We also have a Frigidaire Furnace (that cracks me up every time), which works great.
