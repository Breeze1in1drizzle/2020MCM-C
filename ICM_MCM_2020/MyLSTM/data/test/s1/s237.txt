I thought this would be easier to use than a conventional hair dryer that blows my hair around a bit too much.  My mother had a similar-looking hair dryer MANY years ago and I thought this would work just as well for quick styling, avoiding the need to blow dry using a brush.  I was wrong.  This is very hard to handle, hard to use to style your hair (well, my hair) and worse, the motor sounds sick.  It makes a kind of lame vroom-vroom sound like it can't quite decide it wants to be running.  I should have known I would not get much quality for this price but I didn't think it would be quite so awful.  I will probably donate it to Goodwill, as I think it might be functional, but it does not do what I wanted.
