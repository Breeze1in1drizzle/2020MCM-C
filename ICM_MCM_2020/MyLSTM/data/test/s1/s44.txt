I purchased this blow dryer November 5, 2013. Today is October 14, 2014. The heating element died. I have not dropped or abused this dryer. I expected at this price for it to last longer than a cheap dryer but I am disappointed. I will go back to buying the $20 Conair dryers because other than the price I don't find a difference.
