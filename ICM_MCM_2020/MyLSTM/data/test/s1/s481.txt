I purchased a recently updated condo built in 1969.  All the kitchen appliances were purchased in 2012 and unfortunately all of them were Frigidaire.  Not even 3 months into living in the condo and the Microwave died.  All the keys of the control panel won't work.  I just called to get someone to look at it and they charge $80 just for an estimate.  A new microwave is $200.00 but after reading all these reviews, I will buy anything but Frigidaire. I never had any appliances from this brand before in any of my homes and now I know why.  Total waste of money.
