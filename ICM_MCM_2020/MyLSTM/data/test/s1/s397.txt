PLEASE read the reviews, it could save you time, money and frustration.  I also bought a GE Microwave - Cafe thought it would be a quality product because I paid over $400.00, it also started dying after the first year, the magnatron, which has a five-year warrenty was corroded and had to be replaced at an additional $$ repair cost, part was free.  One day after the 30 day repair warrenty the microwave  totally died -$800 +.  Repair failed to come during appointed time, in fairness they later said they had called and rescheduled, but I had no message on my phone so I waited for 4 hours.  The manager I spoke to was willing to have me wait another five hours on another day, that's the best they could do.  So if you want to throw your money away and get poor service, definitely buy GE products!
