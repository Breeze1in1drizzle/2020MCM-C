I bought this mainly for the drying feature. Disappointed to smell a gross toxic plastic chemically smell every time it dried. It made the inside of the bottles smell this way too for quite a while which made me just feel like there were little particles of chemicals or plastic that must have been stuck to the inside of the bottles. Tried running it a few times to see if it was just because it was new but the smell still stayed the same so i returned it. If it wasn't for the smell I would have liked the product.
