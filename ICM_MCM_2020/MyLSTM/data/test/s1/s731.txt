This product deserves zero stars.  Any liquid medicine flows quickly from the pacifier tip, causing baby to choke from the rapid influx of liquid.  The pacifier is also hard rubber (hard like an eraser or the sole of a shoe) that the baby can't even chew on like a normal pacifier.  We were terrified when my baby began to choke the instant we put it in her mouth.  We watched her for several scary minutes as she coughed and gasped for air.  I thought that we would have to take her to the emergency room, but thankfully, I am a RN and was able to whack her back and hold her in a downward position in order to help clear the liquid from her airway.  We immediately tossed this piece of junk where it belongs: in the garbage.  It's shameful that they call it Hospital Choice when no hospital in their right mind (or with the right malpractice insurance) would expose infants to such an inherent risk of aspirating medicine directly into their lungs!
