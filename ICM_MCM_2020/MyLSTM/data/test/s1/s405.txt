I have a General Electric microwave model PEM31SM4SS manufactured November of 2011 in Maylasia and it is peeling on the interior across the rear top. I replaced the previous unit because of the same problem.  It also was relatively new at the time.  About two years. Painting seems to be the option offered for repair. Maybe General Electric should include a can of paint and brush with their microwave ovens. I will purchase a new one this week but not GE
