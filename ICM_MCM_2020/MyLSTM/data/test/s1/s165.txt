Received a replacement for this one that exploded about 4-6 months ago and that also blew up yesterday....if you use a hairdryer every day this is not the one for you. It would stop half way through drying (and it takes less then ten minutes to dry my hair) and I would have to let it cool off before it would restart. Glad I never mounted it.
