The biggest waste of money I've ever spent. This drier has to be a fake t3 because I've used a t3 for many years and loved it. This drier however gets hot enough, but there's absolutely no power behind it to blow dry the hair. Essentially it's just barely blowing while heating up my hair. My hair takes forever to dry with this thing and after its finally dry it's a frizzy mess. This company seems dishonest as well because in the box there was a large piece of paper stating that they'll give a lifetime warranty if I give a good review! So they're not standing by their product but instead they're essentially trying to pay me to lie! I'm sorry, but I have to be honest and the drier is a piece of junk.
