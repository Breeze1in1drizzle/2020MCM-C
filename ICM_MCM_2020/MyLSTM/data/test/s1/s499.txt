We purchased our oven in December 2011. No problems until recently when we tried to start the oven it would show &#34;pause&#34; on the display and not come on at all. Now it just comes on if the door is closed and nothing has been entered on the key pad. Short lived junk as far as I am concerned. My last microwave lasted 5 times as long and was still working when I gave it away to go to this over the oven unit. Quality is long gone.
