I ordered these because they are awesome pacifiers. What I received however is not what is pictured. The little pictures on the front were totally different. It wouldn't be that bad if they hadn't sent me a pacifier with a big heart on the front, something I would not have purposefully bought for my little boy.<br /><br />I won't order these or recommend them again because It seems to be random chance what you'll receive.
