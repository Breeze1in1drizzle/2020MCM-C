Basic hairdryer that folds.  It doesn't seem like it is strong, but dries our long hair fast.  Downside is that our hair gets sucked into it and that isn't fun! Need a better guard on it, but hey for the price I just hope it lasts longer than our last one<br />UPDATE<br />Don't bother buying this brand.  We bought 2 of them and they both died within a couple weeks of each other.  I wish someone made something that lasted longer than 6 months! I know it wasn't much money, but they shouldn't build them to fail in such a short time!
