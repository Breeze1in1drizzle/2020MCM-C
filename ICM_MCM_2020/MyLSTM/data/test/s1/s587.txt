I chose this microwave to go along with the GE Cafe range I purchased at the same time. I read multiple poor reviews of this microwave online, but decided to risk it because I wanted the microwave to match the range. Bad choice! After owning the microwave just over a year, the magnetron konked out. Luckily, that particular part was covered under a 5-year warranty, but I still paid nearly $200 for labor. Now, just a couple of years later, the touchpad has expired and will need to be replaced. The service department tells me this repair will be a minimum of $250. (Touchpads start at $150.)<br /><br />I have never had so many problems with an appliance. The refrigerator I bought at the same time has never required service. The washer and dryer I bought nearly ten years earlier have only once required service. Yet this microwave has required two expensive repairs within just a few years of purchase. Before I bought this GE Cafe microwave, I had a cheap, unremarkable countertop model. I don't even remember the brand. But it was still working when I upgraded to the GE Cafe, so even though it was nearly 20 years old I was able to pass it on it to a neighbor whose child was starting college. At this point, I wish I'd kept the old one! I will never buy GE Cafe again.
