I purchased this mainly for the retractable cord because my storage space is limited. The cord does not retract well and when it does still leaves about a foot hanging out. Even has a stopper (if it reaches it) that leaves about 8 inches out. I didn't even try to plug it in. Love Amazons return policy.....
