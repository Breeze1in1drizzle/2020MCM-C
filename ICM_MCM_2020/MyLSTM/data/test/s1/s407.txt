I bought this microwave about a year ago.  The exterior is attractive, and it fit well into the space I had for it.  However, after just one year of relatively infrequent use, the top of the cavity is flaking, with big chunks of paint now gone. I've had to throw away things I've cooked because there were flecks of paint falling from the top into my dish. It is ridiculous to have to replace a new and otherwise functional appliance. The replacement will not be a GE.
