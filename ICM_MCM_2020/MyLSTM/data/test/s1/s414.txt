We got the whole  suite of Whirlpool appliances with our new house. Every piece: fridge, dishwasher and this microwave gave us only grief and never ending service calls. And this is after only 4 months of using them, they all fall apart. This oven has a nice display, however, while cooking the door sucks in all the water vapor from below cooking top and the moisture sits there for hours where all the electronics are. It is hooked up to the outside vent however it blows all the hot air back to the kitchen instead of the pipe in the wall. I have technician look at it again this weekend. Save yourself the aggravation and  but Samsung or other high quality brand, Whirlpool quality is a history at this point.
