Few problems with this Dryer.<br />First: I've had this dryer before. It was great, but after using it in the salon for a couple years it stopped working, as they do.<br />Second: The FIRST time I plugged this dryer in the low blast setting did not work (as in, no air came out). I contacted the seller and I've received no response. The dryer is not working, and I just want a different one.<br />Third: This seller is a complete scam! They send a piece of paper with the dryer that says they'll give you a two year warrantee if you leave a 5 star review. Complete extortion. I can't believe Amazon works with these guys. Mind you, since they are not an authorized retailer it is very likely the manufacturer's warrantee is void. This creates a problem.<br /><br />Bottom line: buy this from a different seller.
