I did not buy this here but from the store with the blue shirt associates; my model is SMH9187, which is similar to this one. This was installed by my contractor during a complete kitchen remodel and looked great above the Samsung range. After about 2 years, I got what all those 1-star raters got, a sudden incessant beeping that you could not reset or turn off, other than through unplugging the appliance. I tried turning off the main power, etc. but nothing worked; in fact, the error message and beeping became continuous.<br /><br />Friends of mine have had the same model for over three years and they have not had this problem. Why? Because I cook a lot of steamed food (rice, pasta, vegetables) and they do not. I'm sure the heat and steam from the range top has, as others have noted, damaged the circuit board. The keypad is over the right back burner, and even if I use any of the front burners, the steam will cover the entire front of the microwave; this happens even with the fan at full blast. There is always a film of condensation over the bottom half of the microwave.
