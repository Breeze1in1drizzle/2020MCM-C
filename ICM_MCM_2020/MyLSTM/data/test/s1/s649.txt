I splurged on this item for my daughter two years ago, but she used it maybe 6 or 8 times, as she never took a pacifier.  I love Haba products in general and have always found them to be of really high quality.  My son is now 9 mos old and we've used this pacifier tether maybe 3 or 4 dozen times.  I have never seen him chewing on the beads or string, just the soothie teething pacifier attached to the end of it.  The other day, while it was attached to his onesie and he was tugging on it, the string gave way, sending beads flying all over the room.  He of course put some in his mouth immediately.  It looks like a knot hidden within the beadwork came undone, but I'm not sure.  I am grateful I was there and he was not hurt.  I notified Haba and the CPSC of the potential choking hazard.  Haba responded quickly and professionally by email and phone, including a request that the pieces be sent to them for further investigation.  The CPSC called me in response to my online report and told me that because of prior complaints, they have an ongoing investigation into these pacifier chains, and they are sending someone out to interview me and take photos of the pieces before they are sent back to the manufacturer.  It is a really nice wooden alternative to some of the other paci tethers out there, but until they figure out whatever the problem is, and if it can be fixed, I can not recommend it to anyone.
