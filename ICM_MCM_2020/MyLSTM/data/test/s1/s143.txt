DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS MERCHANT! I ordered this blow dryer 3 months ago and it has already broken. The merchant will not replace it and neither will Amazon because it is past the 30 day warranty. Amazon first told me they would replace it, but then changed their mind. I believe that when you pay over $100 for a product that breaks only a couple months later, it should be replaced. I suspect this product was used and refurbished. My advice would be to buy from a salon or beauty supply store because then you can register it with the manufacturer, which you cannot if you buy it through Amazon. I am very disappointed with this product and the service I received from the seller and would discourage anyone from falling into the same trap I did.
