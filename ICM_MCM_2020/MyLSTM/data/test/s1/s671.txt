I was looking for a quality paci for my baby but he hates the nipple. Even for a newborn it's way too small and pops out easily. Also when I opened the package the paci seemed to be coated in...something? Like an oil. Even after sanitizing the residue was hard to come off and reaked of rubber, definitely not something I want my son ingesting. We now exclusively use the MAM brand paci's and he prefers those nipples and they never smell or have a weird substance on them.
