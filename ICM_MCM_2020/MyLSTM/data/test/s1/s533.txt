Same as every one else..this microwave is three years old ..broke twice ! They know they have an SE problem and continue to sell their junk!  Same as everyone else they want you to pay to fix it...told us last time we got it fixed they resolved the problem...well broke again SE AGAIN ..so I will never buy from them again...I will tell everyone I know not to buy their junk ..is it really worth it to screw people over like that?
