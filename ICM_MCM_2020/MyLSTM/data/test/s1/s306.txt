This hair dryer blows so much smoke, it has to be unhealthy for my hair. When I made this purchase I was looking for a high wattage, ceramic ionic hair dryer. After the first use, I have realized that it probably has a high wattage but the other selling points may not be true. I have always purchased professional hair dryers and never did they blow out smoke like this one. I do not recommend this product and wish I didn't waste my money in such a poor quality tool.
