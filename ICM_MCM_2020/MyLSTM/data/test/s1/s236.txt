After only using it once I noticed the bristles on the brush attachment have already started to flatten.  I am returning it because I can only imagine what it's going to look like after daily use for only a month.  I noticed another reviewer wrote s/he is looking for replacement attachments.  I'd rather just buy a better quality product to start with.  Also, the power of this hairdryer doesn't even match my cheaper Conair dryer that I bought at the drugstore and was hoping to replace with this more expensive and supposedly better quality hairdryer.
