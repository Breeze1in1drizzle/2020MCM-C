The worst blow dryer I have ever had! This dryer make more noise than blow hot air. I let my hair partially air dry than blow dried it, and it took forever to dry (between 45min-1hour to completely dry using the blow dryer). That was the longest it ever took for my hair to dry and my hair isn't long or very thick , it's ear length. It isn't a strong blow dryer AT ALL! it gets hot, but that's about it!
