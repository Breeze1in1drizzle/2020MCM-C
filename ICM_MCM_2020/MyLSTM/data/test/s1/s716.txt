I ordered these before my daughter was born (0-6 month size) and decided I wanted to order more because two was not enough.  I ordered them a week or so ago (same size 0-6 months) and the nipples are different sizes!  My daughter will NOT take the smaller nipples.  This is very frustrating because they are the exact same order of the exact same size!  I'm extremely frustrated because she will only take the original ones (I lost one so I'm down to one).  I'm scared to order again thinking they won't be the right size!
