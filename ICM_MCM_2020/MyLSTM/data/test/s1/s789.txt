The picture shows four pacifiers with four different colors. The actual product is TWO pacifiers and they are identical and clear. If you have two babies, you can't tell which pacifier is for which baby. The picture is misleading!<br /><br />Also, these pacifiers don't have holes by the nose. I have babies about 8 lbs (preemie twins now one month old) and these pacifiers cover part of their nose and make it hard for them to breathe. I don't think they're safe for smaller babies. I would advise getting ones with holes by the nose
