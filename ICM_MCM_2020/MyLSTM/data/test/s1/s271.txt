This hairdryer was a fine replacement (while it lasted) for my wife's old (used for 8+years!) Conair dryer that she loved.  She figured sticking with Conair would be a safe bet, given how long her mini travel dryer had lasted.  WRONG.  She had this one less than a year before the plug box started repeatedly shorting out whenever it was plugged in.  (We've never had any problems with other appliances plugged into the same outlet, including other hairdryers).  Ultimately, the plug box started smoking from the repeated shorts whenever the prongs touched outlet.  She just had to toss it and will have to buy another one far sooner than she expected she'd have to.  Conair should make better quality products than this!
