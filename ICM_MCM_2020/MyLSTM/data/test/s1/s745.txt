I was given 2 wubbanubs as a gift for my twins, and they loved them so much I ordered 2 more. I wanted a spare for washing & in case we lost one. I ordered a giraffe & elephant to go with the frog & red dog that we already have. They arrived just the other day and I gave the giraffe to my son for the first time yesterday. Today I realized there is a tiny hole in the leg and it is leaking tiny beads. Now I'm afraid to give any of these to my children. I'm disappointed because it seemed like such a great product & the kids love them.
