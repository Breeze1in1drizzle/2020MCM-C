We bought all new Samsung appliance for our new home. The microwave and refrigerator have had to be repaired. The microwave started leaking microwaves and burned the inside lip of the unit and on the inside of the door, burning the paint. Samsung replaced the unit after it was seen by an appliance repairman and photos were uploaded to them. My replacement unit just died for no reason. I checked the outlet, breaker and plug - all fine. I have to wait another week before the appliance repairman can come out and tell me I'll have to wait another 2 weeks for a new unit to arrive. Then, I'll have to pay for it to be installed again.
