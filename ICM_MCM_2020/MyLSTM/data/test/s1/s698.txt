My baby girl had a hard time finding a pacifier that she liked besides using me as a pacifier. I saw great reviews for this product so tried it out. Definitely a hard nipple and still at 3 months old, she doesn't like it. It IS a shorter pacifier than normal, so she doesn't gag, but she doesn't like how hard it is.
