I'm a big fan of con air and ION dryers in general. However, I'm disappointed in this product and would not recommend it.<br /><br />1) The styling attachment falls off 5-6 times during any blow dry. The latch or ability to attach is minimal. While blowdrying your hair, expect it to go flying and fall to the floor. Extremely frustrating and annoying<br /><br />2) The coord is very short. Unless you have an outlet right by your mirror and from waist-level or higher, you will need an extension coord to use this dryer.
