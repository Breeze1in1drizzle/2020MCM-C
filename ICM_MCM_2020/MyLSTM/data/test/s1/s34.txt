I was pleased when I first received this dryer.  But after struggling with it I now realize it is a bust.  The flexible tube fits into the bonnet with such a tiny turn that it is impossible to keep the tube there.  You must hold onto the tube or it falls out.  And it gets so hot it is difficult to hold.  I thought it  would get easier to use after a few tries but it is hopeless.  I hope no one else gets conned into buying this.  If it hadn't been for struggling with some surgery I would have returned this long ago.
