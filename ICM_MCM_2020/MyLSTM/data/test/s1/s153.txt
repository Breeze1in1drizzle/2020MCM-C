I was just using what I thought was my trusty dryer when it literally BLEW UP in my hand.  Sparks went flying and there were pieces as far as 10 ft away. The entire back of the dryer exploded.  I have never been so scared of an appliance.  I have contacted the company and have not heard back from them.  Please do not buy this- it's very dangerous!
