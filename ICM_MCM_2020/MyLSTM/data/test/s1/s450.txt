We purchased the MW in Janurary, our contractor installed it the last week of April, it died two days later and Sharp service took three weeks/ two service calls only to have it go out ten minutes after they left. Amazon assures me that it will be resolved but not the seller. They want to repeatly waste our time and call service, have us wait then what? DON'T BUY THIS MICROWAVE.
