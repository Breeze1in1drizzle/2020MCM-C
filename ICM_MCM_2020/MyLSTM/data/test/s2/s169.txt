It was a nice hair dryer, came highly recommended by several sites. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 10 uses before the power began to surge and there was a distinct ozone odor coming from it. For safety I shut it off immediately. I don't use a hair dryer that often, so I had already had it past the time I could return it. I don't know if mine was a dud or not or if it perhaps was damaged some way in shipping, but I hesitate to buy the same model. It was to replace a dryer that had lasted me over 10 years, so I am very disappointed.
