We bought this about 6 weeks ago, and it has already stopped beeping when the nipple is sterlised or milk is warm. Now the markings on its measuring cup is coming off.<br /><br />Basically, I believe Minchkin has cut corners with poor quality product. Not recommended at all...I would prefer some other brand.
