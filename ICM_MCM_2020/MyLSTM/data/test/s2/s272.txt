Very easy install to replace our 2001 version of this unit. Able to retain the old mounting plate, plus all hanging screws, rear vent, and power cord lined up perfectly. A 10-minute change out of the old unit and install this unit. Some features updated/improved over the past thirteen years. Only obvious design flaw is the faint grey almost-invisible text on every control panel button, especially the Start/Pause and Cook Time buttons. In its infinite wisdom, GE placed these two major buttons directly below the huge control panel knob, so they're always in shadow because no overhead light shines on them. Would have made more sense to print the text in bright-white like GE did on our Profile slide-in range, or maybe even back-light the buttons. The old unit had a design flaw where the door's handle lower fastener broke off all the time requiring a service call and part replacement. This one has a stronger handle, but the buttons are very hard to see. If we had it to do over again, we'd choose a different model/brand.
