I bought this product based on a previous product we had for our first child. The Pacimal's brand is much better as the stuffed animal is better quality and most importantly the pacifier can be replaced, or taken out and sterilized.<br /><br />This product does not allow you to remove the pacifier. I will not be purchasing another one. I will keep this one for now, but will definitely be purchasing another Pacimal.<br /><br />Also, as someone else posted before me, the giraffe's neck is flimsy. Woops. Didn't think of that when I was making my purchase.
