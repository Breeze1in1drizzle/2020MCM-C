This product was listed as a 2000 Watt Ceramic/Ionic hairdryer.  It certainly had 2000 watts and was as loud and powerful as a jet engine in my bathroom.  However, despite the power, the heat was lacking.  And, it was so powerful, it was difficult to control fly-aways.  Not recommended for curly hair where you are trying to control frizz and defeat humidity.  Too powerful, but not hot enough to help.
