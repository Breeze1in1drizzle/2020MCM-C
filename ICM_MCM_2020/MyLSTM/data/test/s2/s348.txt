It was a great replacement for the Gerber (6-12 months), that is not being sold at any stores or online. After 3 weeks it became sticky and we had to trash it. For the price we expected it to last longer. Also when its dropped it blends with the hardwood, rolls around and lands under a piece of furniture 6 or 7 feet away. Not so great if the baby is crying and you have to crawl around looking for it.
