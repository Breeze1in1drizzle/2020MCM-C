My son prefers the MAM pacifiers, which is what earned all 3 stars here.  If I were just reviewing the MAM pacifiers, I would offer an enthusiastic 5 stars.<br /><br />My demerits are for the misrepresentation of product in the photos.  I placed my order based on the primary photo, which shows 1 clear & 1 red pacifier.  The boy has a mouthful of teeth already, so we only hang onto pacifiers for 6ish weeks & I thought the clear & red would be fun for the month leading up to Valentine's Day.<br /><br />Today I received a pink Punk Princess & a purple Girls Rock! pacifier.  Truth be told, I considered letting him use the purple Girls Rock! paci, because girls do, in fact, rock & I like the color purple.  But I'm not looking to emasculate my little man with anything princess, punk or not.  That's just not cool.<br /><br />In summary: change the photo, Amazon & send me the clear & red set, please.
