Let's talk about the form of the GumDrop nipple itself. I'm a mother of 6 children - nursed all of them. Our first child first used a pacifier (Avent, silicone, flatter nipple, 10 years ago) and after 18 months of chasing binkies in the middle of the night, I swore them off. Our middle four children sucked their thumbs to varying degrees and now our 6th has a fierce suck reflex, but he is too little and uncoordinated to reach his thumbs when he wants them. After receiving an orange newborn GumDrop from the hospital (out of desperation for a few moment's peace), I purchased a double pack newborn and a double pack 3+ months from Amazon. After the first week I noticed the newborn paci consistently popped out of our son's mouth when he would relax. I could never hold him one handed while doing chores. My other hand had to be pressed against the paci to keep it in place. Also, during suction he would have to suck really hard, making loud sucking noises - as if he could never get enough nipple in his mouth. This caused him to swallow a lot of air, which meant he had to be lifted from a reclined, dozy position to be burped. Also, his lips always tucked inward, not outward like they do on the breast. Putting him down for a nap was impossible because he would either 1). startle himself awake with the sucking noise/air swallowing/gas or 2). the paci would pop out after two sucks and he wasn't tired enough to overcome the reflex.<br /><br />Thinking the newborn size nipple might be too small I ordered the 3+ month size and noticed hardly any difference. The silicone is slightly more rigid in the 3+ month paci, but there is no difference in nipple length or width (see pictures).<br /><br />After thinking about it some more, it occurred to me that the GumDrop nipple doesn't mimic the human nipple in any way, what-so-ever. My 6th child is getting a far larger human nipple than my first - comes with the territory! My newborn needs a larger nipple to be satisfied. He also needs one that conforms similarly to a human nipple, which flattens considerably during breastfeeding. The GumDrop nipple unfortunately retains its original rigid shape when the baby relaxes. My nipple remains flat (stuck in the suction of the baby) when my son relaxes. Tonight (5 weeks later!) I finally broke down and bought a Nuk, since it appears to mimic a veteran mommy nipple: longer, flatter nipple that retains flatness and doesn't pop out of Baby's mouth. Hasn't fallen out all day. Baby is sleeping soundly now.<br /><br />I would also agree with other commentors that it is unclear if First Years is the same as Hawaii Medical. My hospital paci has a 1-800 number stamped into it, not &#34;First Years&#34; like the Hawaii Medical GumDrops I received from Amazon. As you'll see in the photos, the hospital paci has a &#34;matte&#34; finish (which probably feels rougher, more like a human nipple) and the First Years is shiny and smooth.<br /><br />*photo (left to right) orange newborn GumDrop, green 3+ months First Years GumDrop, blue Nukthat conforms similarly to a human nipple, which flattens considerably during breastfeeding.
