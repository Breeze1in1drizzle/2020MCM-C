While she doesn't seem to be suffocating, these pacifiers don't seem to have a deep enough cut out for my daughter's nose. It seems like it must be uncomfortable. I am really disappointed because she loves the older model of this pacifier (hand me downs from her sister) but I can't find them anywhere now!
