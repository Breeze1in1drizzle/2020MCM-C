Not worth it.  If they get direct sunlight for awhile during the day they glow brightly but not for long.  By the time my daughter has her night wake up (3-4 hours after we close the blinds) they're not glowing at all, so by the time I need them they're done.  Will not waste my money on these next time and will stick with the regular MAM pacis.
