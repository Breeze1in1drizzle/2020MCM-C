My son must have about 25 of these guys by now. He loves them all, but I wouldn't say equally. He has some he likes for bed, others for play, and a very few are loved so greatly they can do both. But this little bunny with her bright colors and fancy ears manages to be welcome in both his crib, or his stroller. Fancy that.<br /><br />This pacifier is the same amazing quality as all the others we've received. I'm sure &#34;Cora&#34; will be with us long after the pacifier has met it's end. I like the notion that giving up the pacifier when it's time will be a smoother transition since he can keep half of it. And really I think it's the half he loves most. We bought a mini pack in play and he doesn't like anything but his special wubanubs going in there. He puts them in, pets their back, and says &#34;Oh, babies&#34;. In fact the first time he said baby was when he was talking to his special friends, they're his babies. :)<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />After using this pacifier for a short while the decorative stitching on her face has started to come undone. Her nose has almost completely unraveled. I have never had the problem with wubbanubs but this is upsetting. There needs to be better quality control, this is a baby toy. I bought my son the pink bunny for his Easter basket and I'm going to have to really check it over before giving it to him. He was so sad when his purple one &#34;got hurt&#34; and I'm pretty mad he was distressed by something so avoidable.<br /><br />*SECOND UPDATE*<br />As I mentioned above we bought this in both pink and purple. While the pink seemed solid at first the stitching on her nose started to unravel as well. We own close to 30 of these and these two are only ones to have issues like this (we had a penguin that came with a ripped pacifier but that's a different issue). Clearly the quality of this particular style is lacking. To have both come apart in the exact same way is really disappointing. I've fixed both noses myself but I should never have had to do that. For this reason I'm bringing this down to 2 stars down from my usual 5 for all my other wubbanub reviews.I'm bringing this down to 2 stars down from my usual 5 for all my other wubbanub reviews.
