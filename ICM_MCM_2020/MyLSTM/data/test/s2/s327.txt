I thought this was a good purchase until it finally arrived.  I did not like how the soap and water got stuck inside the pacifier. Not only is it difficult to get out and clean, I feel that it's unsanitary to give to a baby if you don't sanitize it in hot water after every use. I sanitized it in hot water for 5 ~ 10 minutes before use and my son did not accept the pacifier at all which I don't mind because it would be a pain to sanitize after every use. The only positive thing about the pacifier is the cover that it comes with because if it didn't I would have given it one star.
