I wanted to like it, but the first time plugging it in and pressing the switch up, i heard a snap and the switch was no longer workin. Sent it back.<br /><br />Gave it two stars for the benefit of the doubt: Sometimes these things just happen. That, and the item despite being lemon, it felt like decent quality, especially for the price.<br /><br />Might try another one in the future, maybe there was a batch batch.
