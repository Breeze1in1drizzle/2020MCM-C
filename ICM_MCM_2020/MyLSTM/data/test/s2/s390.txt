These pacifier attachers are ok...but there are better ones out there. My son never used a pacifier so we have these to help keep his toys attached to the car seat, high chair or stroller. The end that grabs the toy/pacifier works great (good length), but the clip end is very large. It is fairly easy to operate so my son is able to take it off already by himself (10 months old). I can't imagine we will be able to use them for very long.
