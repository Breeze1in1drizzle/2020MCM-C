This Hair Dryer popped up when I searched for dual voltages hair dryer. I was disappointed to find out it was not after receiving the product. I decided to keep it because at least it is fold-able. However when I took it to my Eastern Europe tour, it burned out on the first day & even blew the fuse of my hotel room. Hotel electrician had to come to re-set my room's fuse at 11 PM. Luckily my voltage transformer did not burn out so I had no problem keep on charging my cell phone & my tablet for the rest of the tour; otherwise my trip would be totally ruined.
