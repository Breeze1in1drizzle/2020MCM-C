It is what it is for a $20 hairdryer. I didn't notice anything better or worse then most hairdryers I have owned except that it does automatically shut off if you use it too long. I guess it overheats? It will pop the circuit and I let it cool a bit and then hit the reset and it works fine again. If you have thick hair that takes a while to dry this would not be the hairdryer for you.<br /><br />UPDATE: So a few months later and this hairdryer has turned out to be not so great after all. It overheats quickly if it is on high for more than a minute, even though I have cleaned the dust screen, and it shuts off. Very annoying.
