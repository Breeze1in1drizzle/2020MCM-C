This microwave looks great and I really like the &#34;30 second&#34; feature. It also has a unique footprint that works well for kitchens with limited counterspace. BUT for $150, it should have lasted longer than 14 months. After 6 months, it started making a very labored noise after being on for more than about a minute. At 14 months, it caught on fire while I was trying to warm up a cup of coffee. For my next microwave, I will buy something that looks less sexy, for less money, and hope that it will be more durable.
