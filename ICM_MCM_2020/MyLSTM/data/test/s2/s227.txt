I've only had this for less than a month and, full disclosure, I didn't purchase it from Amazon but got the exact same model from Best Buy (I should have read the reviews here first before it was installed!).    The good:  It looks nice; the stainless steel finish must have some kind of coating on it because it's much easier to clean than some of my other steel appliances; the overall size is decent on the inside.  When it's cooking, I have to say this is the quietest microwave I've ever owned.    The not-so-good:  I've never had an over-the-range microwave with the handle on the door before and I hadn't really given that feature much thought before making the purchase.  It looks nice and all, but the handle gets untouchably hot if you're cooking on the stove;  I don't think I'd ever buy another with a handle again because it's kind of a nuisance to have to use an oven mitt to open the microwave (even more of a nuisance if I forget to use a mitt and put my hand on hot stainless steel).  It's very hard to see inside of when food is cooking.  There's one bulb and it's quite dim, plus the door has a screen-printed pattern on it that makes it even harder to see into.  The exhaust fan for the range technically has two settings, but they sound almost identical... and it's VERY loud. If the microwave is running for a long period of time or if it starts getting overheated from the stove below, the fan automatically turns on.  It's a smart feature to prevent it from overheating, but again the fan is super loud, and you can't manually turn it off once it kicks on.    The bad:  Oh. My. God.  The freakin' beeps when it's done cooking are INSANE!  I've never, ever had a microwave that didn't stop beeping upon the door being opened.  Not only does this continue, but the 3 beeps are extremely loud and at least 5-6 seconds long each!  And if you don't open the door in a timely fashion, it doesn't remind you with a gentle, short beep;  instead you get the same 3 ear-shattering YokoOno-screeching beeps every 2 minutes.  I've found that if you hit the stop/cancel button before opening the door, it'll stop the beeping... but again, it's another nuisance that I've never had to deal with in any previous microwaves.    The other bad thing I've found is that the touch pad scratches EXTREMELY easily.  I only use a microfiber cloth on it and it still looks like I went at it with steel wool covered in broken glass.  I tried using a plastic/fiberglass polish and it didn't do a thing.  However, I've found that using granite countertop cleaner/polish at least minimizes the look of the scratches a bit.    Overall, I'd advise people against purchasing this model.  Its negatives outweigh the positives... especially when there are so many other, better choices out there.
