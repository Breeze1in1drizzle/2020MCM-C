I have had this hairdryer for about two years and I have to replace it.  At about the one and half year mark it started emanating a horrible smell.  I take care of my things--there is nothing I can see that found its way inside that would be causing this smell.  Even prior to this issue I was never impressed with this product.  It never had a lot of power.  Wouldn't recommend it.
