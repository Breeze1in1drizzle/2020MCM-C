So, we bought this dryer as a replacement for my wife's old, loud unit.<br /><br />Unboxed it, and it felt nice and solidly built. And it was about mid-range, volume wise. Also a good selection of heat and fan-speed adjustments. But, the first morning of use, it ran for about 3-4 minutes, then the breaker-plug began to buzz loudly, and emit smoke.<br /><br />All use was discontinued, and was returned for a refund.<br /><br />I award it 2 stars for it being a potentially good unit, but subtract 3 for failing. This seems like a fluke, as most of the reviews are positive, but I'm going to be searching for a different dryer anyway.
