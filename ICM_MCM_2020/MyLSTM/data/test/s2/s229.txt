the items was shipped & handled by UPS.  the microwave was bent in several places on the bottom. it was hard to tell if it was that way before packing or done during shipping.  box was damaged as well.  had we not been working<br />on a deadline for a house showing I would have sent it back for an exchange.  but no time.  it appears work just<br />fine and the dents don't show thanks to the shelf it was placed on.  I would expect a discount based on the<br />damaged product we had no choice but to keep.  I have photos if needed.
