The incessant beeping is enough to make you want to put your own head inside the microwave. Next to that, when you select a defrost time, it literally stops every 30 seconds to tell you to turn it over. and wont start ubnless you open and close the door then push start again I HATE THIS THING. Good thing it LOOKS NICE because the features, the beeping, and the UI is absolutely UNNERVING. I am writing this as some steaks are defrosting in it and the constant stops and beeping has just finally gotten me to the point where I had to come here and whine about it.
