We loved the concept of this. Thought our little one would be able to grasp her pacifier much more easily in the car seat. Unfortunatly the pacifier ripped off the caterpiller the first time we washed it.  The stuffed animal is very light weight and doesnt stay in place as we expected (thought it might have the mass of a beenie baby or have a rubber underside so it doesnt fall). Anyway, We bought Sofie the Giraffe which has turned out to be a miracle on car rides instead.
