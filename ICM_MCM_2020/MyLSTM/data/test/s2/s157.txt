My old Remington ProAir Ceramic just died and I purchased this as what I had hoped would be a suitable replacement. Not even close. The airflow is too forceful. Even on low this dryer whips my long straight hair into a tangled mess. The nozzle is too narrow so it further concentrates the airflow. The dryer is on the heavy side for it's compact size..The high heat setting gets way too hot. Even low, once it heats up, seems excessive.<br /><br />It's going back.
