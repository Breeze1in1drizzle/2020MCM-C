We ordered one of these and were shipped an open box/customer return. The bottom of the unit was dented and the interior was dented. It made a humming/vibrating noise during microwave operations. <br />Amazon shipped us another unit which also was an obvious open box/damaged customer return. Looks like people are dropping these during the install, then returning and the factory/warehouse people aren't even refurbishing them.  It was easy to tell it was already used since the exhaust vent was not set to the factory default of recirculating.  <br />It isn't Amazon's fault, in fact they were so quick to ship another unit(2nd day fedex!).  I wonder if other vendors are seeing this problem...  I love the way this looks over my stove, but it looks like they wont be sending another one due to the problems with the warehouse.
