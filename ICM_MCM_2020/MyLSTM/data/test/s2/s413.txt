These pacifiers didn't work for us; unfortunately our breastfed baby would not accept these pacifiers and repeatedly spat them out. We had better luck with Nuk pacifiers, which have a nipple with a flattened bottom. These may work better for bottle fed babies who are accustomed to this nipple shape.
