I was excited about getting this dryer after reading the reviews.  Ive been a hairdresser for 12 years so unfortunally i have carpal tunnel.  This blowdryer is heavier than it says and it is very loud.  At home use would be ok but in salon use....not so much.  I actually returned this dryer to amazon.
