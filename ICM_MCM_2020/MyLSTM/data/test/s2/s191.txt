For the longest time I was trying to figure out what the bad smell was in my bathroom.  Turns out it's the plastic piece that covers where the cord meets the dryer.  It smells a little like asparagus pee!  Totally confusing and I kept cleaning until I figured it out.  It's been weeks now and while the smell is getting better, I still smell it.  If you have a good sniffer, like I do, you probably want to avoid this product.
