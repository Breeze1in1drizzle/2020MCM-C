This case does not fit 2 pacifiers.  I tried to put 2 newborn paci's in there and I literally had to shove it in and force it to close.  The paci's I had were not oversized either.  They were your average size pacifier so I'm not quite sure what kind of paci's they used to test this product out because there was no way you could fit 2 in there without some effort.  I used it twice and never looked at it again.
