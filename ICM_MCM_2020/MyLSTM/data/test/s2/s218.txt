I have an LG 1680BB over the stove microwave which is less than one year old.  The construction seems flimsy to me and the controls do not seem very well thought out.  It appears to me that the controls are made for a new family with really small children.  The presets are for things like oatmeal, babyfood, hot dogs, that sort of thing.    The main problem I have with the oven is that the handle just came off.  I looked closely at it and the plastic around the two screws which hold the handle on is melted and cracked.  It looks like the microwave heated that area enough that the plastic melted and then the rest of the handle cracked until it simply fell off.    I will never buy another LG microwave; not unless they are significantly improved.
