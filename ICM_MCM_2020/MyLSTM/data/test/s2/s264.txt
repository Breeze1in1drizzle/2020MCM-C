This is NOT a one touch simple to use microwave as advertised. I bought it because many reviewers stated that the start/stop button was also an &#34;add 30 seconds&#34; button. IT IS NOT. Even the picture buttons are not easy. First you have to push one of them, then the number of them you are cooking and then the start button. That is 3-touch, not 1! I bought this for my parents in their nineties. No way they can use this. It's going back. P.S. The inside is stainless steel and would be easy to clean.
