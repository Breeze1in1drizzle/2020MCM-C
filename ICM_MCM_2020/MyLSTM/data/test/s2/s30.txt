I purchased a hot tools blow dryer and they sent me a Helen of Troy blow dryer that looked exactly the same except for a few details. they put it in a hot tools box and everything looked exactly the same. I am disappointed because I like the brand hot tools and they never said anything about Helen of troy. the dryer works fine and everything but it had dust and dirt smudges on it when I got it.
