The description is misleading relative to heat/air settings. There are 2 air speeds and 2 heat settings plus a no heat button vs. 3 air/heat settings. The air speed, and not much of it, is the same on high and medium; the heat changes. On low, the heat is the same as medium but the air flow decreases.    I have medium-long hair and was looking for a dryer with three distinct settings. This doesn't have them. My old and working Conair has only two settings and is more effective than this. At 1875 watts, the air flow on this is sad. Perhaps that's intentional and I just fail to understand why high isn't very high. The cool air button on the back is marginally inconvenient. Regardless, here's one to avoid and I'm going to try to return the one I got.
