I started out trying to give my newborn daughter this pacifier.  She sucked it a few times and then rejected it.  I was hopeful she would take it b/c I heard such good things about it and how it is supposed to be the best pacifier for breast-fed babies to avoid nipple confusion.  In the end, my daughter took the Gerber NUK for about a month and then refused all pacifiers all together.  Just as well since they say to wean them off around 4-6 months anyway.
