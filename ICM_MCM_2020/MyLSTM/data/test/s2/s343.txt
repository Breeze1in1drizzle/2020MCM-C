I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews and thought this may be something to help my little one sleep. We tried lots of different pacifiers, but he never really took to any one style. I thought I would try this because of the idea that it could help stay in his mouth. However, the results weren't any different from all the other pacis we tried. Maybe it works for younger babies but at 2 months, it would still fall out of his mouth when he turned his head so it didn't really keep it in place. To be fair, maybe my little one just isn't a pacifier kind of kid, which is fine, but we didn't have the success that so many others seem to have with this product. I was also a bit hesitant because of the fact that the pacifier is sewn to the plush toy but I was willing to deal with it at the time. However, it really would be a much better product if there was a way to separate for cleaning.
