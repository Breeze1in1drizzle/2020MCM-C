Replaced older Profile unit with this one. Some changes necessary for mounting, fortunately, the exhaust duct was in the same position as the older unit and installation took about 1 hour. Love the larger cavity size and rotating table. Helps to warm foods more evenly when using microwave. Works wonderfully as microwave and as convection oven. Saves us energy by allowing us to bake many foods without having to use our stove's larger gas oven and it works quickly. Only two &#34;observations&#34; we have are: 1. Touch Pad is very difficult to see in normal light. Attractive design, but near impossible to read as the gray typeface on black background is horrible choice. Not a big change for GE to make, surprised that engineering has not yet ordered such an important and easy revision. This may well be a safety and/or frustrating issue for some persons. See the labels I ended up making for the touch pad. (See Photo) 2. The volume of the beeper (at loudest) is barely audible.  Other than the above two &#34;cons&#34; we are very happy with the purchase. Good value!  Update May 2016 - First time we used the convection heater at 400 degrees, after about 5 minutes, the oven died - was as if a fuse had blown - Ge service arrived the following day to diagnose the problem, a blown thermostat. Estimate about 300.00 for parts and labor.  Considering this oven is only ablut 2.5 years old, that's far from what our years of GE products repair experience would dictate. SHAME on GE.
