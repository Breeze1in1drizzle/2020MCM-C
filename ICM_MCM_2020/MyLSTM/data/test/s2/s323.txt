These are fine, but they actually have a top and bottom where the other ones we use, are dual sided. The &#34;bottom&#34; side of this if flipped over (as you know, you cannot explain the top/bottom concepts to a 12 month old), then it is not as easy for them to breath. I wouldn't say it impedes any breathing, but it doesn't have the same airflow. I like the other pacifiers we use better. I would not buy again.
