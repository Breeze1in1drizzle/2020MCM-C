UPDATED Sept 2015:<br />This dryer died today after almost catching on fire.  I sniffed a burning smell and 2 seconds heavy sparks came out and it died. I only used it twice a month to dry my dogs for about 30 minutes each time. Always cleaned lint out of the air vent. Very pricy to last just 13 months with limited use. Does anyone make a quality product??<br /><br />his is a terrific dryer for the price here on Amazon.  It seems very well built and has a lot of power without being too loud. It has three heat settings and two power settings.  I love it.  Great for blow drying my two dogs on a cooler setting.
