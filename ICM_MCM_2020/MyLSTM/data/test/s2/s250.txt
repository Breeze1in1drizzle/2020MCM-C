I bought for my father-in-law's truck. In terms of its size, it was perfect fit for the truck with inverter built in but as other people described, it's not working properly with the inverter. I think it will work normally with normal AC but not through the inverter. The inverter was rated as 1500W. So $50 inexpensive microwave works better than this one. I had to return it. :(
