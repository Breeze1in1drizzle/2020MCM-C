So far, I am not too impressed with this warmer.  Using the exact amount of water suggested with the level, I find that the Avent 4-oz bottle of breast milk is still COLD.  However, scalding water drips off the bottle as I pull it out of the warmer (be careful not to burn yourself!).  I plan on trying different amounts of water to see if I can get the right ratio - but for something that is supposed to be a help, it is just creating more work for me...thankfully, Peanut doesn't mind his milk a little on the cold side.
