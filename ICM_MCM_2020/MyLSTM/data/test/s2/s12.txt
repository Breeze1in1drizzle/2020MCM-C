Gifted this to my mom in India. Since they use 220Volts in India, I needed something with dual voltage. What I realized was this dryer only works on the HIGH setting at 220V. I first thought the button was jammed, so tried again after switching to 120V and the button to switch high/low worked. I was very disappointed, but couldn't return the product since I was in another country and this was a gift.<br />I believe the product is designed that way, I wish they mentioned it. A low setting is critical to set a hairstyle or curl your hair.
