I bought this for my 5 month old son because he likes having a paci at night as well as a stuffed animal. First of all, the paci on this is horrible and it is way to small for a 5 month old to hold in his mouth. Would be soo much better if it had a larger pacifier and a MAM type pacifier. Do not wast your money
