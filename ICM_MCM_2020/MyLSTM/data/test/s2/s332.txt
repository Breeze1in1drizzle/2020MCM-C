I didn't notice that the colors may vary.  I thought I would be receiving green, blue, and orange pacifiers for my SON.  Instead, he got purple and pink pacifiers.  Lucky him!  Yes, he uses them, and yes, he's been called a girl by strangers when they see it!  I don't want to get into stereotypes, etc., really, but if you want a specific color, don't order this.
