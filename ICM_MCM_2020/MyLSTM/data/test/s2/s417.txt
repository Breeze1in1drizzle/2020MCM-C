At about 15 days old, I gave in and tried a pacifier. It was a larger Nuk that someone gave as a giftâ€”at the time I had no idea there were sizes for these things. After a day or two, our daughter seemed to &#34;latch&#34; with this and I got a nice long nap. Since it seemed to work well for her, I decided to come here to Amazon and order a few (and discovered the Newborn and other size options).<br /><br />Because I had her on a larger one previously, these &#34;Newborn&#34; pacifiers were immediately useless, as she would seemingly not even notice there was something to suck on and it would fall out of her mouth. The larger one we had gotten as a gift has a cover than closes when it falls, but my wife doesn't like that because she thinks it will leave a mark. I don't even know the size, so I am going to experiment and order some more now. Hopefully we'll get the right one.<br /><br />If you've used standard latex feeding nipples, these may not work for your baby at all because they are too small.
