It's definitely cute and Barbie-like. It does have an option for 250v or 110v... problem is, when in Europe even tho' it was on the 250v setting, both speeds were the same: HIGH and both temperatures were the same: BOILING HOT. I couldn't put the diffuser close to my scalp as the air was just too hot. When I got back to the states I tried it on 110v and it had two speeds and two temps but still way too warm for a 'low' setting. I wasn't able to return it because I'd passed the deadline by the time I got back from my trip. I will probably donate this... it doesn't really work overseas unless you want to burn your scalp.
