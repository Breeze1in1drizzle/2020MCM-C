I received this as a housewarming present, it fit perfectly in the space i had in my kitchen.  It worked fine for several months no complaints, however a few times I discovered it would turn on by itself, it freaked me out but I'd unplug it and then plug it back in the next time I needed to use it.  After about a year the microwave started sparking inside the microwave from the side panel.  At first I thought there was some metal in the microwave, but there wasn't and it happened a few times since.  I was scarred to use it so I stopped and forgot to unplug it until it started turning on again by itself.  I thought the thing was haunted, it really creeper me out.  I eventually googled it and I now realize my mistake I should of returned it for repair earlier, this is a serious fire hazard.  I did not purchase this one from amazon but it is the exact same model number and color ( black and stainless steel).  If your microwave turns on by itself unplug and return or replace asap!!
