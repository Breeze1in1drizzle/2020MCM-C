Cord is way too short.  I can't hold it over my head when standing in my usual spot.  Also, it's not hot enough.  The hottest setting is more warm than hot.  It is lighter and quieter than most, but I still regret buying it.  I did not tried the attachments.  They went into the trash along with the box.
