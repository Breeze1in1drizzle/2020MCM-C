The 5 star reviews are a bit of a stretch. I've had a Vidal Sassoon dryer for almost 15 years now and I thought maybe I should step into the 21st century. Honestly this tourmaline stuff didn't make a difference in my hair. My hair is usually very shiny but this dryer dulled it for some reason. I do like the gripy texture and the color scheme is cute, it's much darker in person.  It would've been better as a grey color.  I'll probably air dry my hair mostly and finish up the rest of the moisture with this.  The worst part about this dryer really is the switch. I mean they seriously couldn't see this design flaw and couldn't make it more basic and sturdy? The switch shakes around and feels like it's about to break off. Anyway, I was going to return it but didn't want to go through all the trouble.
