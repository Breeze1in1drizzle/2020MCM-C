My 3 month old has a hard time keeping the pacifier in her mouth. It slips out easily, unlike traditional pacifiers that she can hold onto. I also find this very difficult to attach to the Born Free Pacifier Holder. You need a lot of strength, which is not always easy for a new mom with sore wrists!
