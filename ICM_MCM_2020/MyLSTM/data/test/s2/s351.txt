[[VIDEOID:mo2RBN29PVQ4LTY]]By the look of this pacifier I would never have thought it possible to fall apart, but it has.  I purchased this about a month ago and my baby loved it.  My baby is a newborn, so obviously he's not chewing on it or doing anything crazy to damage it.  There is a semi-hard piece of plastic in the inside of this pacifier, and I guess the sucking motion itself caused the hard plastic to cut its way through the soft plastic. Now the soft plastic has worn off of the sides of the pacifier and it looks really torn up. If my baby was old enough to maneuver the pacifier himself it would even be considered unsafe because he could easily tear off more plastic into his mouth. I am going to order a new pacifier now, but not this kind.
