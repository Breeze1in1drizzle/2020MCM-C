I have owned this type of hair dryer for about 8 years.  However, this particular hair dryer I just bought in September 2013 to replace the previous hair dryer that was the same as this, but it was a different color.  It has worked perfectly well until the other day.<br /><br />I don't know if anyone else has ever had this experience ever!  I have sometimes left my dryer plugged into my outlet after blow drying my hair and this time was no different.  But after my last usage on Tuesday I became sick and paid no attention to the dryer laying on the counter in my bathroom.  But I kept smelling a sweet smell coming from the bathroom area and just thought it was my plug in freshener.  I had just bought a new insert.  But the next day I saw a puddle of red underneath my dryer and I saw that the area next to the plug reel up was melting!!  Really, does something like that happen.  I pulled the dryer plug immediately and put the dryer on a paper towel and it continued to seem to melt.  Red kept flowing from it for quite awhile.  This could have been a fire issue and something inside the dryer overheated.  I don't know.  But I do know I feel uncomfortable using it and threw it away and will have to purchase a new one.  To Conair ... shame on you for manufacturing such a shoddy piece of equipment!  If anyone be able to illuminate me on what happened or has experienced the same thing, please reply and let me know.  Oh and I gave this dryer 3 stars because it worked perfectly up until the melting.  In fact I'm upset that I won't get to continue using it, but I won't take the chance now.
