My wife wanted a smaller microwave for the counter top.  This was perfect --- at least for 28 days.<br /><br />On the 28th day - all the controls appeared to work but the unit no longer heated.<br /><br />Amazon's return policy was to issue a refund - I wanted it fixed so I contacted Whirlpool directly.  They stated the product had a full replacement guarantee for 12 months and that I would receive a call within 48 hours on how to get the unit fixed or replaced.<br /><br />It's now one week later - no response from Whirlpool and I can no longer get a response from them regarding the commitment they made me a week ago.<br /><br />I decided to contact Amazon about the issue.  Amazon is sending me a return label and issuing a refund.  (I should have done THIS in the first place and never bothered with Whirlpool).<br /><br />I just ordered my SECOND unit from Amazon --- I'm hoping this one will last longer than 28 days.<br /><br />I would give the unit 5 stars if it had not failed --- now only 3.  If the second one fails - I'll drop it to 1 or zero stars.<br /><br />I give Amazon 5 stars for service on this item.<br /><br />Joe
