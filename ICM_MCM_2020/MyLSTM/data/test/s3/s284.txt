This is a nice hair dryer, but as hard as I've tried to figure out why it's a $130 hair dryer, I just can't find the value.<br /><br />I have pretty short hair and don't use a dryer that often, so I admit that I'm not the target market. But my wife has very thick long hair and uses a blow dryer every time she washes her hair. I've kept a close eye on her hair since she started using this dryer and I can't detect any difference either. So I asked her directly, would you pay $130 for this? No, she wouldn't. She said that it's not much different than her $40 dryer.<br /><br />I like the fact that there are two independent controls: temp and air speed. That's nice. I also like the fact that you can override the heat and blast cold air on demand. That's a great touch.<br /><br />But as far as the moisturizing and conditioning aspects, I can't detect them at all. I'm not typically such a skeptic, but when a product costs substantially more than the everyday version that I've been using for years, I need to somehow be convinced and wowed that the product is really worth paying so much more. Unfortunately, I wasn't wowed by this dryer.
