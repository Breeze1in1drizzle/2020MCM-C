SEPTEMBER 13, 2013 over one month after delivery AND STILL NOT USABLE!!!! GETTING UPSET.<br /><br /> THE RATING REFLECTS THE FACT THAT IT IS NOT WORKING YET !!!<br />So I can't be sure that it will.<br />The unit was delivered and it is what I wanted because it is exactly like the one I had for 14 years (newer model of course); but it has not been working as it should. I wonder if the tech will really getting it to work correctly. Waiting now for parts to fix the oven portion of the unit. The tech tells that the microwave portion only cooks on the sides and the center does not get the ray to cook the food, How can that be possible?? Anyway here I am one full month after purchasing the oven and can't use it. I still will be happy if they get it to work properly.<br />Love the fact that the color is not bisque --- thankfully it is almond like the previous one although the bottom of this one is white .... why??? Was it refurbished???? Original bottom damaged ???? Will never know.
