This hair dryer works well, however, after about a year or so of use, the clear plastic coating around it, has started to peel off. This speaks to the quality of the materials used. It still works and I still use it but just wanted to mention that. It is pretty light, which is a good thing when you have a lot of hair to dry! The main reason I purchased this one was because it was more affordable than the salon brands.
