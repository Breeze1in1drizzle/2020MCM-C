I ordered a whole bunch of these in different shapes and sizes. Unfortunately they are useless at this point as outside part is way too heavy and falls out of newborn's mouth. (even at 3 weeks.) She has strong suction, but since she needs to take a breath here and there it is enough time for these pacies to fall right out. (which frustrates her and starts screaming) SO unless I hold it in her mouth until she falls asleep she cannot use these. I hope later on they can be used with more success.
