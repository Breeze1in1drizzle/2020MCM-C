We bought these when my son was born, but he never would take a pacifier when he was an infant.  He's been going through a bad teething spell this week, and I got out this pacifier to see if it helped.  Surprisingly, he wanted it ... but then he got the entire thing into his mouth and nearly choked on it!  He's 13 months old.  If you're thinking of using this item beyond your child's infancy, you might want to choose another product.  The package says for all ages, but they're not big enough for young toddlers.
