I have very limited space so the design to fit in corner is great. I only use for re-heating or defrosting so it is fine for that. Some of my dinner plates are too large to fit in it...so I use smaller plates for re-heating. I don't like the lack of number pad but I knew it didn't have one when I bought it. It DOES have it's own popcorn button...:)
