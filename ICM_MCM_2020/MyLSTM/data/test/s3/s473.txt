I really liked the idea of having wipes handy for when my baby drops his pacifier. But it's only good in theory. The box is too large to carry around in a diaper bag, so I just ended up throwing it on the coffee table. But when we're at home, it's just as easy to wash his pacifier than it is to wipe it. Also, they tend to dry out, even if you have the lid closed! Another annoying thing: it's hard to pull just one out at a time. You pull out 2-3, then have to stuff some back.
