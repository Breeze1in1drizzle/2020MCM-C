I've owned several of these and while you'll get loads of compliments from bemused strangers at the grocery store, these absolutely will break after a month or so of use.  They always snap in the same place first: top left (if you're looking at the paci face-on) handle &#34;corner.&#34;  Sharp edge makes it a risk for babies and useless on a pacifier strap.  Then the top right corner of the handle will snap and you'll have no handle left.  Happens each and every time, just during general/daily use (i.e. it's not like we stepped on the thing).  Bummer.
