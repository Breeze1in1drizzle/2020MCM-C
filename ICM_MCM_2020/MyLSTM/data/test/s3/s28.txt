I have purchased 3 of these hair dryers and the last 2 have not been satisfactory!  My daughter has the original one and it's still going.  I however, purchased one the same time she did and it just wasn't putting out the amount of air it did in the past.  So I replaced it with another one and it's only been months and it doesn't get as hot as it used to.  Very frustrating to pay so much for a dryer and not have it perform.
