Let me start off by saying, I love this pacifier!  My daughter has the yellow duck and the red dog.  My problem is that both are made of fleece material.  I am a very clean parent, but the fleece material has attracted all sorts of dirt and lint that simply will not come off.  I want to purchase two more, so are there any more of these out there that are NOT fleece material?
