I was so excited when I found out that such a product exists.  But, when I actually went to use it, I was very disappointed.  Both my 3 yr old and 11 month old had trouble sucking it.  With my older son, I figured he had forgotten what it was like to use a pacifier or maybe it was too small for him.  But the baby LOVES his pacifier and is an &#34;expert sucker&#34;, so I was sadly disappointed and somewhat surprised when he had so much trouble keeping the thermometer in his mouth long enough to get a reading.  Oh well.  Guess we'll go back to traditional thermometers.
