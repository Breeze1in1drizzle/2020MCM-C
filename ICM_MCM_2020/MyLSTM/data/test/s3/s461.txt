Maybe it's because my baby is super fidgety, but this doesn't really do a whole lot for keeping the paci in her mouth.  Maybe when she's a little older, she will be able to put it back by herself.  She is 2 months and unless you have a baby who is swaddled and doesn't move, this doesn't do much.  I had such high hopes too, but I guess I'll still be getting up every 10 seconds to put the paci back in her mouth.
