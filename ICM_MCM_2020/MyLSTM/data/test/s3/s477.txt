We love all products AVENT!<br /><br />First, Philips AVENT has the best customer service.  To make things easier retain a copy of your AVENT receipts (although, unnecessary).<br /><br />Second, our baby loves the &#34;non-Soothie&#34; AVENT pacifiers.<br /><br />Third, these are not as good as other AVENT pacifiers.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Cost, these are relatively inexpensive (great if you misplace them)<br />- Love the cover that comes with the pacifier.  Great to throw in the diaper bag and not worry about it getting dirty.<br />- I like that there is no up/down - pacifier can be used either direction<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The hard plastic on these pacifiers are very flat, unlike our other AVENT pacifiers these don't seem to bend at the edges making them seem a little awkward.<br />- The hard plastic seems much thinner on the edges - probably just a preference, I just don't like it - I like the rounded edged pacifiers.<br />- WEIRD CON: We have a stash of pacifiers in the crib (generally out of baby's reach) and we only use pacifiers at nap times not bedtime - so when baby grabs one of these pacifiers on his own accord you have to look carefully whether he has it in his mouth because it looks strange on the night-vision of the video monitor.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />- I probably wouldn't buy these exact pacifiers again - but would suggest other AVENT pacifiers - and Philips AVENT in general.
