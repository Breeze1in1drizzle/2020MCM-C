I shouldn't complain.  I did not buy this for a baby. I bought it for my kitten who insists on suckling my neck!  I tried to get him to suckle this instead by resting it on my shoulder.  No go.  When I wasn't looking one day he chewed the nipple off it.  And it's too big for him to play with.  I think there is something about the bright red color that he finds intimidating as well.  It's the only toy he won't play with.
