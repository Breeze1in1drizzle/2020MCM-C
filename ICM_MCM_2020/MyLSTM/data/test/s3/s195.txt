I bought this hair dryer two years ago, and it worked great for its tiny size. However, after flipping the voltage switch to 220 for trips abroad and then back to 120 for domestic trips several times, the switch got misaligned and it was stuck on 220. I figured I'd just have to keep it at that setting, as it still worked okay. But a week later the entire handle fell apart in my hand.
