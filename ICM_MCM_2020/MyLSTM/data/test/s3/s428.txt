I wish there was a way that you knew the product was working. Just not convinced that it's necessary. It's easy to use and has a fun, cool design. Other parents are impressed that we have such a clever gadget. Seems like if you have room for it, why not. But with babies, come lots of stuff, so I think you could take or leave this one.
