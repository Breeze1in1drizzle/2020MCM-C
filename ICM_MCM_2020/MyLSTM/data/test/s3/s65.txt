I'm a dad so hair dryers are completely foreign to me.  Bought this for my daughter and when her mom saw it I got scolded as it's small enough that hair may be able to be sucked in causing some very bad times.    I would say it works.  She would say it doesn't work well enough.  3/5 stars as there are a few glaring issues if it's not only for a last resort.
