I like this because it is colorful and cute. I sometimes use it when I swaddle my daughter but it doesn't stay in place that well.  I thought I would like the wubbanubs because she could hold them but she doesn't do this and they are harder to hold to get them in her mouth than the regular soothies.  We basically use the regular soothies most of the time.
