I contend that a real manly hair dryer would actually shoot fire into your hair to dry it.  But, even though this hair dryer does not do that it is still a good product.  It has plenty of heat and power, runs fairly quiet and has all the usual features - high and low speed, warm and hot heat, a cool air burst button, and even ionic technology (for what that is worth), etc.  And it has an attachment for focusing the drying air.<br /><br />It is marketed to men but in the end it is still just a hair dryer, red and black and sleek - so really not any less feminine than any other dryer.  It does not shoot manly flame or melt women who touch it but if you want to dry / style your hair it should work just fine.
