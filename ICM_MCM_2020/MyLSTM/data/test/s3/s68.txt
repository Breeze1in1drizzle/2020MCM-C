Fits a need, but not as nicely made as the model it replaced. The base is all molded plastic and is not really integrated with the hair dryer. What I mean is that there are two notches cut in to the plastic base and the hair dryer cord is run through the notches with some rubber grommets used to hold the cord in place.<br /><br />There are not a lot of alternative products to choose from and on the plus side it was relatively cheap and easy to install.
