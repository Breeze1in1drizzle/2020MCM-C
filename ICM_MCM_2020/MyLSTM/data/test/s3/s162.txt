OK hair dryer.  I like the non-skid rubber thingies on the sides of the dryer so it doesn't slip off bathroom shelf.  The overall drying could be improved.  My Vidal Sassoon travel dryer of the same wattage dried my hair much faster.  I'm going to buy another one of those again and just keep this one as a backup dryer in our guest bath.
