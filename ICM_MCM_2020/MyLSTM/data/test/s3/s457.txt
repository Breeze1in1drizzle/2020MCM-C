after using a Wubbanub for a few months I dont' like this as a pacifier holder. It's HUGE compared to the Wubbanub. My baby is seven months and when he is napping the bear doesn't move with his head from side to side like the Wubbanub does. It was slightly difficult to put the soothie pacifier on but not impossible. I ended up cutting it off because I just couldn't get it off to use the teether attachment it comes with. I like it much better as a teether holder!
