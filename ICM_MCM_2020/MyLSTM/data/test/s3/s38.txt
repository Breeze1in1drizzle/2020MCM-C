I bought this because I was looking for a faster drying, and more quiet hair dryer.  My husband always complains about me blow drying my hair in the mornings before he gets up. In all honesty, I can't tell the difference between this one, and my previous $10 Revlon one from Walmart. It takes the same amount of time to dry my hair, and to me, it doesn't seem any quieter.  I do like the IDEA of the Ions leaving your hair less staticy and healthier, but I don't know that I can really tell the difference. My husband hasn't been complaining about the noise as much, but I don't know if its because he knows I bought a new hair dryer trying to please him, or if it's actually a lower frequency. To me, with it up close to my head, I can't tell a difference.
