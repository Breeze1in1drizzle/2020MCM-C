I purchased this for a trip I was taking to Mexico.  It arrived on time and was exactly as described.  Unfortunately after looking at it and feeling it's weight I decided to return it.  As you know the airlines have strict weight limits on luggage. Given I was traveling for two weeks out of the country I need the room in my luggage for other items.  In order to reduce the weight something had to be left behind and I chose to forgo the dryer.
