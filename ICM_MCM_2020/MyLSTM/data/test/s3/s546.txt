i have a number of avent pacifiers and my husband is always losing the covers of those pacifiers.  when i saw these, i thought they would be great.  they are a great concept except for one detail: the plastic of the covers is quite hard and leaves a mark on the baby's face.  my son doesn't seem to mind, as he happily takes this pacifier (or any other one i give him, he's quite the laid back baby), but i feel bad when i take it away and see the red marks around his mouth.  i love that if i drop this it snaps shut (it has to be dropped on a hard surface for it to snap shut; if you drop it on a soft surface it stays open), and that there is no danger of losing the cover.  but i tend to rarely use these because of the marks that they leave.  perhaps if the tips of the covers were made of silicone, it might not leave as much of a mark on the face.
