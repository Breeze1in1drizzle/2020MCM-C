I'm a little disappointed, Andis.<br /><br />I bought this dryer for trips, and it does what it needs to do - it folds up, it dries my hair. But it's rather loud, and the cord isn't entirely retractable, and it's frankly a little underpowered - it's slow. Is it fine for trips? Yes. But I've used much better, stronger dryers that cost far less. Be aware: You're paying for the label, not the performance. (&#34;Ceramic&#34; - oh lord, that is truly up there with &#34;ionic&#34; in the pantheon of absurd &#34;just paint it on there and add another zero to the price&#34; labels!) I don't hate it, but I wouldn't buy it again.
