I put baby wipes in this bag and put it in a tight cross over bag because I was going on a trip.  It is a really cute bag but leaked.<br />I was really hoping it would not leak because it is adorable.  The bag was stuffed tight, not sure if that is why it leaked?<br />But if it is a wet bag I would hope that it would not leak in any bag that I would put it in.  I will keep it and use it for something<br />else - not sure what at this point.  Disappointed that it leaked. How it leaked was it was wet on the corner of one of the sides -<br />I went to pull it out and it was damp - and you could see where it was wet.  Cute design and maybe needs some fine tuning.
