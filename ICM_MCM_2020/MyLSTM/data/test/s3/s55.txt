So the bad news is that it doesn't get as hot as I would prefer.  It barely gets the job done and I'm a guy w/ short thinning hair.  I am sure ladies w/ thick, long, wet hair will require more time drying w/ this dryer.<br /><br />The +'s are that it's simple, compact, has a good working retractable cord & has a deeper air flow sound that is easier on the ears than a high pitched blow dryer.
