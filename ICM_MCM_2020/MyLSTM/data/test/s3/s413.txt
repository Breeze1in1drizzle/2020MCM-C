I bought these for our son's (4 months)pacifiers and small toys.  We travel alot and are at A LOT of outdoor events that don't always have a convenient place to wash dropped items off.  The wipes are small and will clean a binkie or a small toy but not much else.  They do leave a bit of an after taste on the items.  The package fits well in the diaper bag and has a great closure on it so that the wipes don't dry out.  I think a baby wipe would probably do the same job as these wipes but I do like them...not sure I will buy another pack though
