We have had this microwave for about 6 years now, the Light button has just stopped working but everything else works on it still.<br /><br />Pro:After reading the manual we were able to type in a button combo that mutes the annoying BEEP. This was a nice feature to add in. It cooks fine and we are happy with it.<br /><br />Con: Minor inconvenience, when cooking popcorn (about 3 bags of it one after another) there is a thermal cutoff sensor that shuts the microwave off if it gets too hot, this is easily solved by just letting the microwave cool off or cooking bags of popcorn on a plate.<br /><br />This microwave is extremely cheap and if we have to (because it would cost more to replace the control panel/light button than it would to replace the whole thing) we would probably buy it again.
