3 stars - it's ok. I feel like this hair dryer is a little lacking in both heat and strength, but for the price I can't complain too much. I generally let me hair air dry or only use it for my bangs, so it does the job. If you're a serious blow dryer, go for something else, Personally, I'll go for a different model next time, but in the meantime, I'm fine with it.
