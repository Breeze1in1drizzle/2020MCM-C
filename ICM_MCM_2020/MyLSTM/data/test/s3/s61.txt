Small and light weight. Quiet, relative to our old one which was loud through the bathroom door. On low fan speed, it's very quiet, especially with the bathroom door closed. Good value at ~14 bucks for the white one. Black one is 22 bucks for some reason.  UPDATE: After ~14 months, the on/off switch started to malfunction. It's sticky and engages sometimes but mostly doesn't. Knocking off a star from 4-star to 3-star. This apparently is a common complaint. I took it apart to see if anything can be done but the flip switch itself needs to be replaced and I haven't found a suitable replacement since no part number is indicated. For the price, I'll probably just buy another because it's what works best for us in terms of power, quiet and weight.
