The shape and brand and texture are the same as the one I received from the hospital, but the color to this one is a slightly lighter orange (more translucent) than the one I received at the hospital. I gave it three stars because for some reason my daughter can tell the difference between these and the one from the hospital. I put this one in her mouth and she makes a face and spits it out. And yes i did wash it before i used it. She prefers the one from hospital one. I can't figure out why because they seem the same to me.
