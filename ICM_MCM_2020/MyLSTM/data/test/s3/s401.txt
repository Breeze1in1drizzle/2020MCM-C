So in my quest for the perfect paci, I purchased this after my little rejected the orthodontic ones. Turns out, she didn't care for this rounded one, either. I suspect it's because of the very strong rubber odor that pretty much starts after only a day or two of use. I properly sterilized and cleaned the paci before giving to my baby, just as the instructions indicated, but no matter what I did, I couldn't avoid the bad rubber odor. I couldn't figure out why she hated these so much, until I put it to my mouth and realized it smelled SO strong. Moreover, they get sticky really quickly, too. A lot of reviewers mentioned that they get sticky only when it's time to replace thm, but all three of ours got sticky only after 1-2 days of use. That is absolutely disappointing and unacceptable for pacis this expensive. I wish that you got what you paid for with these pacis.
