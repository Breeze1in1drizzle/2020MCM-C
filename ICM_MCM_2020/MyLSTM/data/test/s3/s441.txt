These are smaller than I thought they would be.  I didn't pay attention to the sizes and I should have.  The large one would only fit 2, maybe 3 all in one cloth diapers.  The small one is so small that it works as a case for my daughters Nintendo DS.  You couldn't even fit one stay-dry liner in it!    Other than being small the large one works great!
