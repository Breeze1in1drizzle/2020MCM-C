This really could be almost the perfect hairdryer if for only 2 things.  It doesn't get hot enough and it's missing a cold shot button.  The air flow is perfect, I love the different speeds and heat settings, how it feels, the lenth of the cord, etc... It just doesn't get hot enough to straighten/smooth the hair like my CHI did, even at its hottest setting.  I need to flat iron afterwards (my hair has a medium natural wave).  I love the way the Elchim is made, so I'm going to try different models to see if they have what I'm looking for.
