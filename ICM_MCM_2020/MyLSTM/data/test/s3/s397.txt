What I like:    It is the same as her green soothie pacifiers - so it fits her mouth great and is of known really good quality.  Single piece design is nice, and two different textures on the sides is good for choice.  The size of the nipple is much better then that big berry nubby thing that looks like a ring pacifier - that is way too big for her mouth and the nubs all over the nipple part seem to be uncomfortable for her.    What I don't like:    She is 4 months old now, we got it a month ago.  She is teething and chewing on things, but could not hold/manipulate this until recently for any length of time.  Wanted a nipple that she would suck on and the nubs would be right under her gums if she bit down - this doesn't have that, nubs are only on the sides.    It's still too big and bulky for her to do much - and we don't give her a pacifier during the day now except at naps.  So this was a bit of a waste of money for us.  Gave it 3 stars for quality - but it's really not proven very useful for our family.
