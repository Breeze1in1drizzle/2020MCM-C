UPDATE##### I am changing my review to Neutral (3/5) because I now realize that my  (now) 6 month old does not like pacifiers. He may have never liked pacifiers and he may never will. My 3 year old will not ween off his pacifier but my youngest does not do them.  Your child may not like this product, and judging by the other reviews, it may not be the Plush Toy Pacifier, it just might be your kid.<br /><br />Let me just say that this is the worse pacifier ever. If I could use profanity to describe this frustrating little plush toy pacifier, this review would be nothing but four letter words mixed with a couple conjunctions  and verbs and tons of profane adjectives, but since we are all parents or know someone who is, I will keep it clean.<br /><br />This pacifier does not stay in the infants mouth, the plush toy is actually a hinderance to keeping it in an infants mouth, and because of this, this pacifier is useless. The actual rubber part is very anatomically close to an actual human nipple, so to the infant, no other pacifier will do. So now you are ...lets just say you are in a very difficult position because you are forced to hold the pacifier in place , so whats the use. Our infant son is 5 weeks old and extremely fussy during his bewitching hour, a pacifier that stays in place would be so useful at this time, but instead, we are force to deal with a very unhappy child between 7 and 11pm. Maybe this is a great product when the infant is older, but by 3 months, a baby can manipulate is own pacifier, so again this product is useless.<br /><br />If you are a parent to be, please do not put this on your registry. If you are a friend or family of a new parent please do not give this as a gift. If you are the creator of this product , I hope karma comes back and makes you pay for what you have done to parents of newborns.
