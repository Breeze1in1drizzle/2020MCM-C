So, we love these pacis, they are the only ones that my son will take. But as far as ordering them from Amazon goes... Colors may vary? Really? At least give me the option of 'boy' or 'girl.' I wouldn't care what colors I got, as long as I could be assured that I wouldn't be getting a pack of pink and purple for my boy! Please fix this obnoxious oversight, Amazon!
