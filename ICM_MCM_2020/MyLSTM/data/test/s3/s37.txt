If you are a master at wielding a blow dryer, you'll probably love this.  I find it too heavy and big for my hands when I am using the blow dryer to straighten my hair.  With that said, the various heat settings work well.  The concenrator attachments work fine for me.  I purchased this model in part for the comb attachment, but I can't manage the dryer properly with it attached.<br /><br />Update:  When I am not using the dryer to straighten my super curly hair, I like it.  My current hairstyle requires an hour under a bonnet dryer.  I can dry my hair in half the time using this hand-held dryer.
