My baby is now 17 months old, and has never liked this stage of the soothie. I tried switching him to this one when he was about 5 months old or so, and he plain refused to use this one. He preferred the softer stage for younger infants. I kept this one laying around, in case he decided to pick it up and use it when he became mobile, but it never became anything more than something to chew on when he started teething, so I took it away. He still prefers the softer soothie. I tried offering this one again recently, but he just decided it would be fun to bite it and pull it out from between his teeth, so I took it away again.
