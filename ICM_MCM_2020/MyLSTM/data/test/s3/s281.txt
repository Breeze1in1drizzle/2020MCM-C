Pardon my pun in the title, but I'm not overly impressed by this blow dryer. The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was it's weight. It's quite heavy, and much heavier than my last two blow dryers. I don't know if I'll get tired of holding something heavier, but I am hoping that it's an indication of quality.<br /><br />I do like the three heat settings, two air speeds and the cool shot of air, which can be used while drying. It is quieter than my last dryer, which was a Conair with the same wattage. The dryer is a little awkward to hold, however, and I had trouble changing heat and speed while holding it midair and drying my hair. It did dry my hair faster but not by much. I used both attachments to see how they work and diffuser worked like it should - giving curl without the frizz. I had trouble getting the concentrator attachment on the end, and then it blew off the dryer both times that I used it. I don't know if mine just doesn't fit well, but that was a little annoying.<br /><br />It may seem like I'm being knitpicky in this review, but I'm just trying to cover all the bases for a blow dryer. After saying all that, it does what it's supposed to do - dry my hair. If it lasts longer than my last two blow dryers, then I'll be really happy.
