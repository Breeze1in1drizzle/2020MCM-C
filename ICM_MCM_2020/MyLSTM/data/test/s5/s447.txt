1) I can now say I own the worlds smallest Ferrari!<br />2) This hair dryer lives up to the hype!!<br />Not going to lie, I was skeptical at first.  I hadn't purchased a hair dryer in over a decade and the price was a little hard to swallow.  After some reseach and all of the fantastic reviews I decided to go for it.  I am SO glad that I did!  This hair dryer doesn't get scorching hot but gets hot enough and has power like no other!  My hair feels softer after using it and I don't even need to use the straightener afterwards.  I personally don't have a problem with the weight of the hair dryer and it's no louder than any other hair dryer I've used.  If anything I think it's slightly quieter than most.  What used to take about 12 minutes to blow dry my hair now takes 5 minutes, literally 5 minutes or less from wet to dry  (the first time I used it I timed it at 4 minutes 20 seconds!).  It is absolutely incredible and saves me so much time!  Beyond happy I bought this and I would easily recommend to anyone.
