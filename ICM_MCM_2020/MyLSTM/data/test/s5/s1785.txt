My 10 week old is not one for pacifiers which is killing me. She also isn't a thumb sucker. So there are times where she is just completely inconsolable unless we give her a little peppermint water in a bottle, she takes a sip and its over. I found these at my local Kroger last night, and they were completely different from all the other pacifiers I had tried.   I brought them home, popped one in her mouth, she didn't spit it out and was in dreamland in under 3 minutes. The gummi ones didn't work, the orthodontic ones did not work, pretty much everything. I have gone thru over 20 pacifiers trying to find ones she likes. And we have found them. Thank you Playtex. You saved my sanity.
