We put these wubbanub pacifiers in his stocking on Christmas morning and he loved it! He got three different ones and he was so thrilled he walked around with one in his mouth carrying the other two at times trying to put all three pacifiers in his mouth. We couldn't get them at toysrus where we originally found them so we were very thankful to find them on Amazon and get them before Christmas. Thanks so much!
