But my first one was $300! I was thrilled to find one at this low price, and it has additional features! I love it because it works faster yet quieter than other blow-driers, is supposedly healthier for hair (mine is definitely less dry since using it!), and doesn't blow my hair all over at the high setting - it is very pleasant to use. Also my first one was a featherweight and I didn't notice that this one was not until it was already shipping. I decided to see if it was heavier, and it is not. So I am completely satisfied! I bring this with me to nice hotels because it's always better than whatever they provide.
