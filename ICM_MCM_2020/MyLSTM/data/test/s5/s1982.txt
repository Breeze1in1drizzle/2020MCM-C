I bought this for my son before he was even born. Once he was here he loved it. I liked it because in the middle of the night it is much easier to find a pacifier attached to a monkey than one that is all by itself. Now that he is 10 months old he doesn't really suck on the pacifier as much as he likes to cuddle with the monkey. I think this will make it easier to take the pacifier away. One suggestion that I have is buy two..lol.. when my son started teething and drooling the monkey got pretty gross and smelly, and if your kid likes it as much as mine it is kinda hard to put in the laundry for a couple of hours. I have put it in the washer and dryer many times and it is still good as new.
