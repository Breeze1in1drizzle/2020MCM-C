I love this! Not only does it take way less time to dry my hair this way when I'm in a hurry, but it makes my hair voluminous and wavy instead of flat and oily and curly in all the wrong places! There's a bit of frizz but it's not bad compared to what I've experienced at the hands of a regular hair dryer. Amazing product for a curly haired girl!
