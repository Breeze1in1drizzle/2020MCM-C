This item is great for my 2 month old and she loves it. Since she has really chubby cheeks, the other pacifiers that are more rounded tend to make a red mark on her cheeks. This item, however, does not have the rounded wings on it and it's a great item for her. I recommend this item to all chubby cheeked babies.
