These are super cute & my son loves it! I was super anti-pacifier when my son was born, but after he kept giving himself hickies on his arms from sucking so hard, I changed my mind. He took to this right away at about 7 weeks old and now at 13 weeks he holds it and pushes it in his mouth himself-too cute! If your baby like soothies (the ones most hospitals use) then I highly recommend you get this! We had no issues with nipple confusion & he still nurses like a champ.
