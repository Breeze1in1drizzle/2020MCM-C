Looks great, works great, cord isn't too short (a pet peeve), and I love that it has more than 2 settings like many dryers these days. I can even give my dogs a little help drying off in the winter since I can change up the settings the moment it's a bit too hot or cool without going too far the opposite direction. Really liking the product so far. For me, Conair has always delivered.
