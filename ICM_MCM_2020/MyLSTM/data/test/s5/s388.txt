I stayed at a Lowe's hotel in LA last year and they had this hairdryer in the hotel room and feel in love with it.  I liked it's compact, lightweight feel and it comes with a diffuser that I keep on all the time.  I find it dries my hair quickly and it was relatively inexpensive for the $19 I paid for it.
