Bought these to tote along our son's NUK pacifiers.  We can fit this on the skinniest part of the Chicco carseat handle so it's always there when baby boy gets fussy and wants his paci.  This container has holes for ventilation.  It easily fits two or three of the NUK pacifiers.  We've been using this container on a daily basis for 4+ months and its held up very well.  Being plastic its also very easy to clean very well, unlike those fabric paci holders that I also considered.  If your baby uses a NUK pacificer, you should definitely check this case out.  ---updated 1/11/12.  Bought a 2nd case to keep in my car, so that we'll always have a clean, safe way to keep our baby's pacifier handy.
