If I have this right, this is an older, closeout version of the current $300 Evolution hairdryer but for the price it's a great deal.  It is not the identical model to the current one, as it only has 1600 watts vs. 2000 watts for the current one.  But, look at it this way, you could buy 3 of these for the same price as the one from an authorized dealer with a warranty-and you would still have to pay $15+ to have it fixed if it breaks under the warranty.  The one we got came with no serial number as described in other reviews below, but it has been working extremely well and as advertised in that it dries hair significantly faster than our old Conair Yellowbird 2000 watt and leaves your hair feeling much softer.  I'd rather pay $100 with no warranty than $300 with one (that's like spending $200 on an extended warranty).
