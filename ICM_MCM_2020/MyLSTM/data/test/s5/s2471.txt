Bought this for my six month old and she loves it. She carries the turtle around as her favorite stuffed animal and when she's tired she pops the pacifier in her mouth and pets her turtle til she falls asleep. All other pacifiers don't compare. Worth every penny for the joy it brings my little girl and the quiet it brings mommy :-)
