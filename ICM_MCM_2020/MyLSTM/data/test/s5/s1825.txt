My son loves this paci.  It is the only kind he will use.  We tried the Soothie brand but he had a hard time keeping it in his mouth.  It was like it was at the wrong angle in his mouth because of the circular shape and it resting against his nose.  I discovered these and thought I'd give them a try.  They worked like a charm.  He has never had an issue keeping these in his mouth because there is nothing pushing against his nose when he sucks, and because of the contoured shape.    Now I will say that it would be nice if the entire pacifier was solid silicone like the Soothise pacifier is.  I had 2 of the Gum Drop pacifiers begin to peel away along the inside where the internal hard plastic form is.  I contacted the seller who directed me to the Manufacturer.  They were more than appologetic and sent replacements and also a return envelope for the damaged pacifiers.  They seemed genuinely shocked that this had happened to 2 of my pacifiers.  Despite this issue with a few of the GumDrop pacifiers, I still think they are an excellent product.  When you manufacture thousands, if not millions, of pacifiers there is bound to be a few defective ones that slip past quality control.  I do not think that should negate the fact that this is an awesome product.
