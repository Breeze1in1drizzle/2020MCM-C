It is so simple, but helpful in so many ways: 1) helps hold the pacifier in baby's mouth while they are sleeping - this is number one benefit in my opinion  2) it makes it easier for baby to grab and put the pacifier in by herself  3) If I'm holding my baby and she's got this in her mouth I can easily hold on to the lamb's back leg, so if baby stops sucking, lamb does not drop to the floor  4) in the event lamb does drop to floor, pacifier doesn't go bouncing all over the room like regular pacifier does  5) doubles as a lovie/attachment toy  The price seems like a lot for a pacifier, but IT IS WORTH IT -- definitely  My one complaint, as others here have mentioned, I wish the pacifier could be detached from the toy.
