Our child isn't big on any pacifier but he's taken to these ones the best.  They don't have a top or bottom so we don't have to make sure it's in correctly which is nice at night.  They also come with plastic covers that clip right on so when it's in the diaper bag or in a pocket the part of the pacifier our son sucks on doesn't get dirty.
