It is great to have this used instead of fingers or thumbs since it can be taken away later. This pacifier really seems to help with the teething. We actually put one in the freezer and then give it to the baby when he is teething. It works. We have tried a different pacifier and he did not even want it.<br />Now that he is old enough to hold his pacifier, he also takes it out and sometimes teethes on the side of the pacifier.
