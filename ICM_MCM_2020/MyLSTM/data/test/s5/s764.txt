I have been a blowdry failure all my life! Just can't seem to use a normal-size blow dryer to style my hair without blowing all the previously styled hair to smithereens. When I opened the box for this dryer and saw how small it was, I thought What, is this battery-operated?? It will take forever to dry my hair! But I have been pleasantly surprised. It is powerful enough to dry my thick hair, and lightweight enough that my arm  doesn't tire when I style for volume. I can move it around and hold it up in the air, behind my head, whatever. If you have limited arm movement or muscles that fatigue easily, this is the dryer for you. I do wish it had a cold shot button, but that is the only drawback.
