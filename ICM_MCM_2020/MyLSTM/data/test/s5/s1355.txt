Love this hair dryer. Heats up nicely. Light weight can sit anywhere comfortably. Works like a charm. I definitely recommend this particular hair dryer to any one. The bonnet is very large, durable and adjustable. Will probably never purchase the hard hair dryer again. It has a. Compartment for the bonnet and the power cord. Real easy to use.
