Better than my wife's old one. The hair dryer that she had was pretty expensive, but it finally died. I read the reviews on this one and decided to purchase it as a replacement. She loves it. The new hair dryer is quieter and she loves the cool dry feature. Can't beat it for the price and how it works.
