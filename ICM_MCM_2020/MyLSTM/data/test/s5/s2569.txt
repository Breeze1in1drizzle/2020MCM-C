They glow in the dark! It's a brilliant idea. These are not the only glow in the dark pacifiers on the market--others have thin glowing handles--but since the whole big MAM button glows, they are REALLY easy to see in the middle of the night, especially when sleepy, fumbling fingers drop them on the floor.<br /><br />Out of curiosity I held one under a lamp light for about fifteen seconds, then turned off the light and went to sleep. Two hours later when my baby woke it, it was still glowing...two hours after THAT, there was still a faint glow--just enough to see it if the rest of the room was completely dark, so you don't need a lot of light to get these &#34;charged&#34; for the night. If you are going to get MAM pacifiers anyway--you might as well forgo the &#34;regular&#34; ones and just get these!
