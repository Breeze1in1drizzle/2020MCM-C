This is my favorite pacifier. I bought it when my baby was 3 months old. I love that my baby can better keep this in her mouth. Of course, sometimes she still grabs onto the lamb and pulls it out, but the design of this is such that it doesn't fall on the floor nearly as often. I find it most helpful in the car. I can tuck the lamb in the seatbelt straps to somewhat keep it in place, but it is still loose enough that she can pull it out if she really doesn't want it. I bought a second one (different animal). There are so many cute ones to choose from.
