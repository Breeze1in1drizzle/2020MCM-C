These pacifiers are one of the better all around designs we've found. The cutout for the nose means our daughter does not spit it out as much and the nipple is soft enough but substantial enough to keep her interested. An added loop makes it easy to attach a strap or, more importantly, loop around your finger during the inevitable hold where baby is refusing. The clear plastic also makes it easy to see if something is on it or if it's worth cleaning.
