My son must have about 20 of these. He's 14 moths old now and he's never liked the &#34;regular&#34; pacifiers, just the Soothies ones. He used to like the Soothies on their own and played with these, overtime though he stopped using them and switched exclusively to Wubbanubs. He talks to them, snuggles them, sneaks up on and scares them, lol. I frequently search for new designs and was so happy to find this one. He's in the wash now and I can't wait to surprise my son with him. He has buckets of toys, but these are by far the only thing he really likes. Yes he uses it as a pacifier but they're also his &#34;friends&#34;. I can see them sticking around long after the pluggie part has been surgically removed.
