Plugged it in, dried my hair.<br />Brilliant!<br /><br />Cord is a little short, if your socket is waaaay far away from where you normally sit or stand, but the dryer itself is good for what it does, not so hot that you feel like you are burning yourself, but effective in drying my thicker hair.<br /><br />I like it!
