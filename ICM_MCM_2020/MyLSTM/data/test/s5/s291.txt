I had recently been on vacation, and the hotel had this hair dryer in their bathrooms.  I liked it so much I decided I wanted one for my bathroom, found it, and purchased it!  I have no regrets.<br /><br />First of all I love the convenience of having it mounted within easy reach.  I am always running late, so being able to grab and dry is wonderful.  It is a powerful little dryer and dries my hair quickly.<br /><br />I know others complain about the nightlight... in the beginning it seemed bright so I would simply pull the bathroom door to.  Now I don't even notice it!<br /><br />If you're looking for something efficient, practical and convenient, this is the little dryer for you!
