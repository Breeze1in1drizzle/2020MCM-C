Dries really fast. I have to use a brush and brush my hair while using this dryer or else it is just an odd mess. I live in area with high humidity off the Gulf coast and my hair stays flat all day! Even straighter than my straight haired friends. I do have to use another dryer when I want to wear my curls because this dryer takes them out.
