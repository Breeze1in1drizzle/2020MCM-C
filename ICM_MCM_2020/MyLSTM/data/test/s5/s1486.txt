Love this microwave. Product was Easy to install, and easier to operate. The first one we ordered came damaged. The process to return item was a piece of cake. The second one came (from a different company) and was packaged much much better. We used to have our microwave sitting on the counter. We remodeled our 1950 galley kitchen and only had room for a drawer microwave. We will NEVER go back to any other microwave. Well worth the price..<br />Love, Love , Love this product
