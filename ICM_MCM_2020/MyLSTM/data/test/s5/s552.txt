LOVED this hair dryer! Didn't even need a new hair dryer, but at this price, I couldn't resist. I figured my old one would break eventually. I decided to make sure it worked, in case I needed to return it. WOW! I couldn't believe how soft my hair was! My hair is healthy, shoulder length, a little wave, a little frizz. I usually had to tame with Biosilk Silk Therapy after drying. But with this dryer, I don't need to use anything! My hair is silky, bouncy, soft and pretty. It dries faster than my old one and it's quieter (big plus since my baby's bedroom is right next to the bathroom.)
