Bought these for my little one and when we brought her home from the hospital I tried giving her this binkie but she spit it out so we continued to use the Avent Soothie. Now that she's 1month old I tried giving her this binkie and she loves it.<br />I like the fact that it doesn't come out her mouth so easily and the hard plastic around it doesn't hug her mouth like others leaving marks.<br />Also they each come with their own protector case.
