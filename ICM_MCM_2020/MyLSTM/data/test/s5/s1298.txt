My old hair dryer is on its last leg so having this 'Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer' has been a dream. Not only does the price work but it is also packed with features that really make my old hair dryer seem like something out of the past.<br />The features:<br />-Has three setting for hair drying (just like my old dryer)<br />-Drys must faster then my old one<br />-Two cooling air speeds that can be used while drying<br />-Doesn't frizz up hair after using (my hold one would give me major frizz)<br />-Also not too heavy (My old dryer was very heavy & bulky to hold the whole time I dry my hair)<br /><br />Having used this for the last couple of weeks, I have to say how happy I am with it. Drys my hair really fast & I haven't had any issues.
