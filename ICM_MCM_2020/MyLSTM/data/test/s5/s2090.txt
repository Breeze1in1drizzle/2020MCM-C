I loved these pacifiers!  They are the best pacifiers!  My baby was breastfeed and I found these and they are great.  They actually simulate a nipple and move back and forth as the child is sucking.  So they are wonderful.  I have tried all the other pacifiers and my baby still seems to like this best of all.  Only trouble is stores have discontinued them...soo now you can only find them online.  So be prepared to order a few at a time!  Some folks say they have found mold in them.  I disinfect my nipples and pacifiers in boiling water every week and have found no sign of that!  These are a terrific product. I give it a 10 star in my book!
