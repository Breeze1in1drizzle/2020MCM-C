While there is no detectable difference between the 0-3 month pacifier by Avent and their 0-6 month pacifier, the 6-18 month pacifier is noticably larger.  I made the switch from 0-6 to 6-18 at 10 months and neither of my twins seems to notice a difference.  It was time for fresh pacifiers anyhow...
