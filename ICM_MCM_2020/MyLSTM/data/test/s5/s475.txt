I have thick African American hair.  This straightens my hair quickly and I don't need to work SO hard when flat ironing my air with this.<br /><br />I also suggest buying a nice ionic hairbrush like the CONAIR and if you use flat irons, you can find a really good IONIC brand without spending Chi money.  I have the Titanium Tools Jilbere de Paris flat iron.... whatever it is... works for me and cost me around $50. Half the Chi price.  Get the Biosilk or the Chi silk Infusion (use a small amount) to protect your hair... they last a long time and protect your hair.<br /><br />You will rarely need a salon with these ingredients.
