I had a smaller travel Conair for years and it just died. I needed to make sure the next one was up to speed. This little dryer is perfect. I have long hair and I don't like to spend a ton of time drying my hair, so I need something powerful. I use this dryer as my everyday hair dryer, it's small size makes it easy to store and also not heavy to hold so your arm doesn't get sore.<br />Also comes with a switch so that you can adjust the voltage if you travel abroad. Very handy.<br />Highly recommend this hair dryer!
