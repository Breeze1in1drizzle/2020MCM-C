This is my second dryer. The first one broke in half.  I used duct tape to make it useable until I received the new one. The motor continued to work well.<br />I ordered the same model hoping I could use the same wall mounting.  But no, they had redesigned slightly and just enough that we had to remove the first mounting and replace it.  I like the convenience, but I would really like to see them redesign it with a few more features:  keep it compact, wall-mounted, but add a cool function and make it quieter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is very loud, even though they advertise differently.  I would recommend it as is, but would love those additional features.
