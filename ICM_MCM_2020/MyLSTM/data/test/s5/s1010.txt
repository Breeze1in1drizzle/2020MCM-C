I have been using this Remington hair dryer for several years now. I think the one I am currently using is my 3rd, and this recent purchase is my backup for when the current one runs its course.  I am particular in wanting a hair dryer with oomph. I like hairdryers with big bursts of hair - basically that are loud and fast.  I grow impatient with many other models.  This one fits the bill just right.  I also like the look and feel.
