Wife: My 5 month old will not take any pacifier, but this pacifier-like teething toy has been a wonderful relief for her teething woes. This item is one solid piece comprised of firm, flexible rubber. It features different textures, and every angle is chewer friendly. In addition, it is easy for tiny fingers to grip. One down side, it does NOT cool off in the refridgerator.     Husband: Most importantly, she likes it!
