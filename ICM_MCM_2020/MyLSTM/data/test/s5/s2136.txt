I can't say enough about these...we had about 6 for the whole time he was using them..no more lost pacifiers and he could easily put it back in himself at a very young age.  Also by a few weeks old he would be petting them as he went to sleep. I had to return to work at 5 weeks and by 3mos he was sleeping 12 hours through the night with the help of this pacifier.  After the first couple of weeks searching for the pacifier in the dark (he was in my bed in a sleeper thingamajig for week 5-10) I found these!! I worried he would have too much of an attachment to the stuffed animal but he was off this and the bottle by 18 months.  Also, the pacifier is the one they use in the hospital so you don't have to worry about switching.  I washed it in the dishwasher and air dried and also just washed the pacifier part often.  we did lose a few at others houses and had to replace 1 or 2 when they were worn but for the extra sleep those first couple of months, it was well worth the $$$.
