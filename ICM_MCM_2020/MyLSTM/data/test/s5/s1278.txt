I originally came onto Amazon to search for  a dryer that I had found in a store that was out of stock.  Once logging on, I decided to peruse the selection of hair dryers in the same price range.  This dryer had the largest number of reviews and the highest rating.  I was replacing an old dryer and was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and leave it looking smooth.<br /><br />Other reviewers commented on how great the Onei dryer was, citing it's speed in drying, it's ionic component that left hair smooth, and several even mentioned how quiet the dryer was.  The dryer arrived faster than anticipated and I was in love the first time I used it!!  It did dry my hair quickly (the same or faster than other dryers), my hair doesn't require a pass through with a flat iron on most days as it usually did, and it's actually REALLY quiet (like, abnormally so).  While I don't have to worry about waking anyone up, it's quiet enough not to drown out the phone ringing or my music playing while I get ready.<br /><br />The attachments are great...as is the long cord.  I really love this product and hope it lasts as long as other reviewers said it did!
