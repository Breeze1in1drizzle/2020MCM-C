Love these pacifiers! Before he was born I got three types - Nuk, Soothies, and Mam - to try if he was indeed the pacifier type of baby. Nuk was immediately rejected, and he was so content with the Mam that we skipped the Soothies and gave them to the neighbor. He seems to like the less molded shape of the Mam nipple and has been a happy camper since. I'm not so impressed with the glow in the dark because they seem to not glow after an hour or two, even though I set them on the windowsill during the day - however we've found that if he has a couple pacifiers in his crib, he'll put them in himself now if he loses the one he fell asleep with - very nice way to offset the issue of the pacifier falling out and it needing to be replaced (usually by you!) at 4am. Thanks Mam!
