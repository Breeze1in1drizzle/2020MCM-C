At first I used the MAM newborn pacifiers which my daughter also loved, since about 6 weeks we have started using these. They are very cute and she loves them. I have tried others and she won't take them. Some people don't like to give these to their babies, but it is reccomended now to give at bedtime to reduce risk for SIDS. So glad I chose these, they're great.
