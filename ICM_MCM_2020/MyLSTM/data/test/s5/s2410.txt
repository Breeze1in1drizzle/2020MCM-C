Love these pacifiers... unlike some of the ones that are specially shaped for orthodontic reasons (such as Nuk), these ones are the same at any orientation, which makes it easy for a baby to put it back in his/her mouth. I tried another brand, and it was frustrating for my child because she would sometimes put it back in upside down. With this one, it's impossible to do that!
