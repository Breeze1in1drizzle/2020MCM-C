It's a hairdryer.  It blows cold air over a heating element and makes it hot.  That hot air evaporates and carries away the water in your hair, making it dry.  Hardly rocket science.  It does all the above well.<br /><br />The ion function only works when the cold blast button is pressed, so I don't have to worry about where all those extra electrons hangin' off the negative ions will end up.<br /><br />The overall slow speed of the fan coupled with the diffuser makes a nice, safe warmer for cold winter feet, too.
