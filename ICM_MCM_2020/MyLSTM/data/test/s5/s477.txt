I've only used this dryer a couple of times but it is great so far. It is actually much nicer looking than in the picture, it is quieter than my last dryer, it dries my hair a bit faster than my old dryer, and as for the temperature hot is hot warm is warm and the cool is truly cool! The only downside is the cord is like 2 too short when I am trying to blow dry my daughters hair. But I guess that is more of a personal problem ha ha ha! I would recommend this dryer!
