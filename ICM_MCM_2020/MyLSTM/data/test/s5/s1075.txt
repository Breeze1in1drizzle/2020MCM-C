This is an amazing blow dryer. Seriously, I have spent money on models that cost tons more and this has to be the best blow dryer I have ever used. I have extremely thick, coarse hair. They could use it to reinforce the Eiffel Tower's structure. Having hair like this usually means a lot of time and a lot of background music spent in front of the mirror. But with the JF1, I had great results and a true cut down in the time I spent on my hair. And using the diffuser and on a medium setting, along with a heat protectant, I didn't feel as if I was frying my hair to death. At times, I have literally seen smoke arise from my hair using other blow dryers, even on a low setting.<br /><br />I highly recommend the JF1. It is light weight, not as gigantic as it may seem , a great price point, and does a wonderful job. What more can you ask for?!
