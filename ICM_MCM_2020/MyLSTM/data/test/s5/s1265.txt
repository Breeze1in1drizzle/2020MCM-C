I have searched high and low for the perfect hair dryer and I am so happy to say that I have finally found it. Having crazy curly hair I am no stranger to losing the battle against frizz when trying to straighten my hair. I was amazed at how fast I could blow dry my hair and I barely had to use any product to tame my lions mane. Not only that, but I barely had to use my straightener to finish the job! It's an amazing styling tool, and if I had to buy one again I wouldn't hesitate buying another Onei MK-II Air Ionique. And to boot it's a fabulous Christmas present!!
