I've been using this dryer as my main hair dryer for the past four months and I love it. It is light weight and worked in both the US and the Middle East. I also like that the dryer came with the two attachments. The handle also folds in to save space on packing.  One thing I would point out to people looking at the reviews is that you will need a screw driver to change the voltage of the hair dryer. Just something to keep in mind depending on your use of the hair dryer. But I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone needing a dual voltage or travel hair dryer.
