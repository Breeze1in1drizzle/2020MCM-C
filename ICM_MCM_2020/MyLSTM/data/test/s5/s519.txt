Very light-weight.  Dries my shoulder length THICK hair very fast - almost half the time my old hair dryer.  The red color is cool!  Discovered the Andis brand while staying in a Marriott recently and really liked that one.  This is an upgraded version.  I've read that some people think that it's loud but I don't notice it.  Sounds just like the ones in the salon to me!
