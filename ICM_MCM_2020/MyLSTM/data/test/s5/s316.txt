I have had four of these wall mounted hair dryers and love them, they are up and out of the way and stay pretty much un-noticable  No fiddling with on off buttons and looking for a place to store it.  If one leaves the on switch ON and hangs it up, it goes off and returns to the blowing setting as soon as one lifts it again. This is great. on a scale of 1-10 This item scores 11.
