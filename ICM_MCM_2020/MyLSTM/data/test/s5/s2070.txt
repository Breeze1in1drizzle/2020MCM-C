After Gerber changed their latex pacifiers with the rounded ends, I went through literally pacifier after pacifier trying to find one my son would take so I could get some sleep.  These are absolutely the only ones he will take.  The only bad thing about them is they are VERY expensive.  However, it's worth it to get a good night's sleep.
