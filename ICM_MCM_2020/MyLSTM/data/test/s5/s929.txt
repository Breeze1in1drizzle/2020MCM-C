T3 makes the best hair dryers. This is my third T3 dryer...the first I had for 4yrs it only broke after being dropped for the tenth time, the second I had for 2yrs it shorted out on vacation in Cuba (no fault of the dryers just my own stupidity, they are made well & to last) and this third T3 I've had for 1yr. I have long, thick, corse, frizz prone hair & used to burn out other hair dryers in only a few uses whereas these T3 dryers dry it super fast with no frizz & it looks shiny after and they last forever. The concentrated nozzle is great for smooth looks and I love the diffuser for beachy waves. Invest in this dryer and you won't be sorry, just don't take it on vacation & it will last for years and years.
