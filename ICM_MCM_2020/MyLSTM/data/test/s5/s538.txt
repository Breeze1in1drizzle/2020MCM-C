My daughter recommended that I buy this dryer.  I have curly hair that absorbs water and, even though my hair is short, it usually takes a long time to dry one strand.  By that time some of the other hair gets frizzy.  This dryer is a vast improvement over the many other dryers I own.  I also bought it for my daughter-in -law who has long hair and was frustrated with the drying time. Her hair is straight and she loves this product.
