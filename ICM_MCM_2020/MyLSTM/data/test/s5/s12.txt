I've had this hair dryer for almost 4 years now, and to this day I love it. I have dry, frizzy, Hermione Granger-esqe hair so I needed something that wouldn't feel like I'm frying it. I highly, highly recommend it to everyone. It comes with a diffuser which I only used like once or twice but it's ok. I'm gonna have this one for awhile, I love the sleek design too, I don't see it becoming outdated like those pink and green hair dryers from the 70s or something. Thanks scientists at Conair, I salute you.
