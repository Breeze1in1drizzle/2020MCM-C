When it comes to hair dryers, I have to be the weirdest person ever. I absolutely HATE spending money on something that blows hot air. I will buy expensive shampoo and hair products, but I just can't spend the money on a dryer. With that being said, I love this hair dryer! I normally keep my hair wrapped in a towel and then blow dry after I've applied my make up. Today I decided to blow dry before applying my make up, and it took me 3 minutes and 28 seconds to go from soaking wet to dry. Obviously not everyone will have the same results. I have fine hair and it is rather long, it hangs about 2 inches past my bra strap in the back. If you have thicker hair, it will probably require a longer dry time. It really does cut down on my hair drying time. I went from around 15-20 minutes to 3 minutes and 28 seconds.<br /><br />As far as the construction of the actual dryer. Eh. It feels very cheap. I'm curious to see if it will last more than a few months.
