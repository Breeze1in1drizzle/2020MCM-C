I needed a new hair dryer as my girlfriend borrowed my BaByliss Pro TT.  The Remington works great.  Everything works as it should and it puts out a bunch of air and cools down quickly when you are through using it.  Easy to regulate the temperature and the unit has great fit and finish.  The one item worth noting is that the Remington is about a quarter pound heavier than the BaByliss which may be an issue if you use it for long periods of time.  I highly recommend this hair dryer.
