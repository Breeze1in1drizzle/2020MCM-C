I bought the duck Wubbanub first as an intro pacifier after waiting 6 weeks to introduce pacis to avoid nipple confusion. I'd read a lot about Wubbanubs and Soothies (the pacifier brand attached to the Wubbanubs) being a great option for holding.<br /><br />LOVE Wubbanubs! Took a few days/weeks for little one to warm up to using a pacifier but she loves her Wubbanubs. I bought the tabby kitty to keep in her crib and we use the ducky for going out. The necks are easy to use a snap-on pacifier holder ( a friend had gotten us one from Etsy with a thick hairband on the end). They're super easy to grasp for little one. It was the first thing she learned to really grab well and to pull back into her mouth.<br /><br />They sit so well on her chest. I like the kitten over the ducky for this reason-  it's a bit wider so it sits really well. And I just realized I can (LOOSELY) tuck it into her swaddle so that it's easy to find again. I just did it for the first time and little one has been starting to go through a sleep regression and she just woke up, found it, and went back to sleep! Holy crap. Why didn't I try this sooner?!<br /><br />Anyways, I've tried regular pacifiers (even Soothies) since and she spits them right out. She liked to hold on to the little stuffed guys. I definitely recommend and I think I'm going to start getting them for baby shower presents, since you probably can't have too many.<br /><br />I will say, I wish I could take off the paci to boil but I wash it with hot water and soap every once in a while and throw it through the wash occasionally (especially the one we take out of the house). And I have stuck the tip into a boiling pot of water before too really quickly but watch you don't burn yourself with the steam.
