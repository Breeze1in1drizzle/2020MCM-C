This hairdryer is much more powerful than the Conair I previously owned as it dries my hair in nearly half the time.  It is a tiny bit quieter, but still makes a decent amount of noise (about the same as a powerful hand vacuum).  It is a perfect size for the bathroom.  The only thing I would change is to make the power cord recoil as it is nice and long, but must be wrapped up after each use or left to hang.  That said, I still highly recommend this hair dryer.
