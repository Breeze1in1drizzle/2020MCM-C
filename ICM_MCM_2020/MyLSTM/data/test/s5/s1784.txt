I see not a very good opinion about this product. It got broken after 1.5 month but still it was my daughter's favourite one. And I getting another one. I feel I cannot expect the plastic not to brake when her binky is 20 times a day drop on the floor. That's how my daughter treated it. In fact it looks to bulky on her face but it is only us, the baby doesn't care. And of course she played with it folding and opening the wings nonstop. It realy saved me from cleaning her pacifier too often a day.
