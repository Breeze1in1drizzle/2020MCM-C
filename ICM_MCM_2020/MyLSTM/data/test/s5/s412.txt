I bought this dryer to replace a virtually identical but much older Vidal Sassoon hair dryer (the VS781),which had finally stopped working after probably a decade.  The thing I liked most about the older dryer, and which I like about this one (which is basically the same dryer with a new color and model number), is that it doesn't get excessively hot even on the highest setting, and doesn't blow as hard as most other dryers.      For someone with thick hair this might be a real problem, but I've got very thin, fine, slightly frizzy hair that doesn't benefit from a strong airflow.  Most hair dryers, even on lower speeds, dry sections of my hair so rapidly that I don't have a proper chance to style them with a brush, and the rest of my rather sparse hair gets whipped around as if in a tornado.  That doesn't happen with this Vidal Sassoon model.  The oval-shaped barrel seems to also help concentrate the airflow.      I also like the fact that this dryer has three heat settings and two speed settings which can be selected independently.  With some dryers high speed is paired with high heat whether you want it or not.      The ionic setting on this dryer DOES make a difference and makes my hair a tad smoother - however it also tends to make it more limp.  So as a rule, I use the dryer with the ion setting in the off position except when drying the ends of my shoulder-length hair.  Probably someone with thick, coarse hair wouldn't have this issue.         I've had this dryer for only about 5 weeks, so it's too early to comment on whether it's built to last - I was definitely lucky to get so many years out of my older model.  This model might not be just right for every head of hair, but for mine, it's perfect.  I hope Vidal Sassoon continues making this type of dryer for a long time.
