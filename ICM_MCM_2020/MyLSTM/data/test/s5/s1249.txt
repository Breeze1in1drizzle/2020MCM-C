I love this blow drier. Cut my blow dry time in half. I bought the leopard/cheetah print one. The price on this item has changed significantly, unfortunately. When I purchased, this dryer was significantly less expensive than other colors of the same model. Before ordering and receiving I was concerned it was a knock off because it was cheaper than the other two color options. I do think it is real. It works well. Feels well made. I looked at all of the instructions closely on the box for spelling/grammar mistakes which are common with fakes and found none. I've had about 2 months now and it works well. I also had one of my good friends look at it closely. She is a cosmetologist and currently works at a salon that sells this brand. She said it looked authentic to her.
