I'm glad I chose the Mam pacifiers. Of course, every baby has a different preference on the shape. My baby is now 9 months old and still happily uses the 0-6 months pacifier. One of the best things about the pacifiers is the little plastic case they come in; the case is used to sanitize the pacifiers in the microwave. You fill with water to a line and microwave for three minutes. I sanitize the pacifiers every night while I'm doing things around the kitchen. In nine months I have not seen any buildup or mold on the inside of the pacifiers. I know other pacifiers have issues with buildup, so I feel like I made a good buying decision!
