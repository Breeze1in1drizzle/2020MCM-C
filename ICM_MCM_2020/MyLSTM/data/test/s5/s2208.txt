My 12 week old loves this product. She snuggles the little lamb with one arm while sucking the pacifier. The weight of the animal seems to help her keep the pacifier in her mouth which is extremely helpful. I will be purchasing more, however I do wish you could switch out the pacifier. I'm sure this is a safety feature though.
