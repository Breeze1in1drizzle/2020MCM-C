I bought this microwave for my first apartment which has extremely limited counter space.  This tucks nicely in the corner that typically isn't usable space and allows me to still have enough room on the counter for food prep.  It heats food very evenly and fits a full sized dinner plate in it.  Even if I eventually move into a place with a larger kitchen, I'd likely keep this microwave since it works so well.
