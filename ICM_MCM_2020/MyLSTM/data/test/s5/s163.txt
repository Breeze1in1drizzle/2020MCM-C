This is a great hair dryer.  Unlike most non-commercial hair dryers, it gets hot enough to quickly dry my hair.  It's weight is typical for dryers this size.  The buttons on the handle are easily avoided once you use the dryer a couple of times.  I also like the color.  I would buy this brand again.
