if you are a cosmetologist like me you NEED a GREAT hair dryer!  I have yet to come across a GREAT hair dryer! I have had 5 hair dryers in the last 2 years and they have ALL turned to JUNK in about 3-6 months use at my shop!  I figured that I would give this dryer a try since it had a 4 year warranty I could return it for a refund if it was the same OLE dryer as the rest.<br /><br />Boy was I glad I got this dryer! the drying time is cut in half with this dryer and I DO NOT NEED to flat iron the hair after drying to smooth the frizz (oh, did I say frizz?  sorry, this dryer does not frizz the hair!). You do not even need to use any frizz control products with this dryer cause the negative ions that this dryer produces really does close down the cuticle and cause a lot less moisture loss and leaves the hair shiny and silky soft!  This dryer is a lot quieter than most dryers!  I had a client comment Wow - This dryer is really quiet!  I did not even say it was any quieter than any other dryer.  I have gotten raving comments and have been asked where I got this dryer!  All I can say is I got it from AMAZON!<br /><br />I really love this dryer LUXURY OR FERRARI just does not begin to describe this work of art!  I highly recommend this dryer for ALL the hairstylists!<br /><br />I give this dryer an  A+++++++
