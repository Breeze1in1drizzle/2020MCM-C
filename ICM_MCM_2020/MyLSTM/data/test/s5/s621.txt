I've only used this a few times so far, but I really love it.  I've had difficulty finding a dryer that 1) doesn't fry curly hair, 2) isn't too heavy when drying the back of my head, 3) doesn't sound like a jet taking off, 4)has a diffuser, and 4) has separate heat and power settings - with the warm actually warm, not hot.<br /><br />This dryer does all that - I'm a very happy camper!
