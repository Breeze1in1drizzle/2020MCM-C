We used it in a hotel and liked it so we bought 2 from Amazon. Various wind speed.  The air is never too hot. The wind is never too powerful. It dries your hair quickly.  Light-weight, foldable handle plus retractable cord make it easy to travel.  I paid $20 out the door with Amazon Prime. It's better than dryers that are much more expensive.  Now we'll just have to see how long they last.
