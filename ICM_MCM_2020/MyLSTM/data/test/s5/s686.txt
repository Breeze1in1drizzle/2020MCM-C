My wife has M/S and she has difficulty holding the hair dryer. I was skeptical of this product working because it is one of those As seen on TV products. Boy, was I surprised. Out of the box, on the mirror, connected the hair dryer and hands free drying. We happened to have a full size mirror above the bathroom sink. Since the blo and go is a little heavy, I don't think it would work well on a small mirror of a medicine cabinet.
