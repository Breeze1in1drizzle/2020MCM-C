It's a nice little rubber soother... easy to clean. don't have to worry about petroleum chemicals, which is nice. not sure what else to say. My only complaint is that the age recommendation is difficult to find on the packaging, if not impossible to find. I believe I ordered one that was for 3-9 months, but when i received it, I couldn't find this information on the packaging, and felt that the pacifier was on the larger side.
