I see many disgruntled people who have had shipping problems. Sharp  does not put enough packing materials in the box to ship these VIA Post-Office or UPS. At 85 lbs The seller needs to Double Box these and add more packing material and then send via FED-EX or DHL at a higher ground rate and customer will be fine. Thanks <br />thecloseoutking
