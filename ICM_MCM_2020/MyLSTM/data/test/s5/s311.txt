I looked at local retail stores and couldn't find wall mount units.  Don't know why anyone would want one just lying on the counter.  I was skeptical of the Ionic feature, but I believe my hair feels softer and less straw-like after using this dryer.  Feels well made and should last.  At first I thought the high speed wasn't powerful enough, but I think the quietness of this unit is deceptive.  It's really blowing as much air as my old dryer, which was good, but it's so much quieter that you think it's not as powerful.  The night light is quite bright and is a pleasing green, but I wish I could turn it off during the daytime.
