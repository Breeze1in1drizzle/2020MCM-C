I love this microwave. I needed something that could go in my new kitchen island and I did not want to spend a fortune for something that had mediocre ratings. This microwave has had mixed reviews but it is working great for our household. I would say the only somewhat negative is that the door is slightly slow to open, compared to a regular microwave door that opens manually. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.
