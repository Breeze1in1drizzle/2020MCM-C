I received my leopard Babyliss dryer from Beauty And, and I believe it is the real thing - not a counterfit. The packaging, accessories, and dryer all appear to be very well-made with great attention to detail. The cord is quite thick and long; you can tell by the cord alone that it is a powerful machine. It is the best hairdryer I have ever owned and it dried my very long fine blonde hair in under 5 minutes, without much heat at all (seems like it would cause less damage to hair). It is certainly worth the $59.95 I paid for it.
