I researched many microwaves for our needs, and this is the perfect unit. It is my second one, as the first I had special ordered to be delivered to a big box store, it arrived damaged. This one arrived fine, well packaged for the trip. It cooks evenly in the convection mode and as a microwave it is fabulous. It arrived when promised. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
