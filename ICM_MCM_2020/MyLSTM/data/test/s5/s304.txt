First bumped into this product while travelling. Marriott Hotels do a good job of equiping their Hotel Rooms with User-Friendly<br />Appliances. This dryer is no exception. Its' small, compact, hangs easily net to our bathroom mirror. My wife raves about.<br />Dryers usually burn out besause the user usually forgets to clean the lint screen in the back of the dryer. I have had this dryer for several years, cleaning it occassionally and its still going strong. There are several styles, check the model that best fits your<br />needs.
