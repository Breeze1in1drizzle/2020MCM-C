These are the BEST bottle out there for our baby.  This is the only nipple shape our daughter will take.  I was surprised that there are NO other bottles with this nipple shape.  I like the venting feature of these bottles and I like that there aren't too many pieces to clean (like the Dr. Brown's bottles I used for our first daughter - what a nightmare to clean!).  These bottles only have 3 large pieces to each bottle (in addition to the nipple and ring).  It does not require any kind of special cleaning brush.<br /><br />They vent wonderfully.  I like that you get two different sized bottles AND two pacifiers.  For $20, you can't go wrong with this gift set.  To buy each piece individually at the store would cost about $30.<br /><br />You do have to be careful with the temperature of your milk/formula.  If it's too hot, these bottles WILL leak.  Also, since these bottles are very thick, it takes a long time to warm up contents inside the bottle.  I prefer to warm up milk or formula in a breast milk storage bottle and then dump it into the MAM bottle when it's warm.
