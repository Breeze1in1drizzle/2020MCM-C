I have had this product for a month and a half it it has worked wonderfully every morning. Not too loud, not scorching hot, dryes hair quickly, and I love the portability. I the retractor need a little help by pushing the cord in a bit at times and it easily snaps to fold. Fits great in my small drawer in the bathroom!
