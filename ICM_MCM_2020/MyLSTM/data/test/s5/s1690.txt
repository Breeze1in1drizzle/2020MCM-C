This kit is just what I needed.  My microwave stopped warming food and made a loud buzzing sound when on.  I didn't want to replace the whole unit because it matched my stove.  I got this kit and it was really pretty easy to install.  Now it works like new again.<br /><br />***There are dangers of electric shock, so do your research.***<br /><br />*Keep track of all your screws and bolts and where they go.*
