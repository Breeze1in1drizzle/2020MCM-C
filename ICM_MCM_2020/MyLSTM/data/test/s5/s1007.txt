I have to admit, as a guy with short hair, I do not use a hair dryer very often.  However, I am all too familiar with the noise they make when my wife is drying her hair in the morning.  To me, her 10 year old hair dryer sounds like a mini jet engine.  I asked her to give this hair dryer a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that the hair dryer did not wake me up in the morning when my wife was drying her hair.  The hair dryer does not have that high pitch noise that makes it sound like a jet engine.  It makes a noise that I have not heard in a hair dryer before.  I would call it more of a low roar versus the high shriek of the older models.<br /><br />My wife was very impressed with the effectiveness of the dryer.  She said that it dried her hair in about half the time as her old dryer.<br /><br />The dryer does feel like it was build solid.  The outside casing has a rubbery type feel as opposed to the hard smooth plastic most dryers are made of.<br /><br />My wife is thrilled with how fast it dries her hair.  Personally, I love the fact that it is quiet and doesn't wake me up in the morning when she dries her hair (I work the graveyard shift so this is important to me).  So far, this is an excellent product and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.
