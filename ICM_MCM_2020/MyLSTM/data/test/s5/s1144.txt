I have this same hair dryer in the purple/pink shade, and got this for my mom as a gift.<br /><br />I've had my hair dryer for about three months now and I use it daily, and it's still going strong. It is a powerful hair dryer, and yes, it is loud-but it has a low setting if that bothers you.<br /><br />I don't see what the hype is about this dryer being really heavy as I've read all over the reviews; it's not light but certainly not weighing my arm down either. It cuts my drying time literally in half, so who cares? The 'cool shot' button works really well which was also a huge plus for me. This dryer has a cartridge that is very easy to remove hair from so that it won't fail as easily. Overall, it's a solid product and I've been very happy with mine.<br /><br />Side Note: Conair will replace within four years if this breaks if you call them, which sealed the deal for me for a $30 dryer. I called and asked Conair about this directly before I purchased mine through Amazon. It doesn't matter it's through a third party.
