My son LOVES this monkey. It doesn't fully function as it should, but he still gets a kick out of it. The chords that the pacifiers attach to are too short. My baby can barely get one of the pacifiers in his mouth, so it's difficult for him to suck on. I can understand why the chords are short, they don't want it to be a strangling hazard. Despite this, my son still loves looking at the monkey in his car seat. He'll &#34;bat&#34; at the chords and chew on the sides. The monkey stays in place, unlike his other toys on hooks that just slide around.
