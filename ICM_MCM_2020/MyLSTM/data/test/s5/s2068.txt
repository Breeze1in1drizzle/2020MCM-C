Some folks complained about how small the 2nd bag is.  I ordered two of these at $5.99 per set.  That means I paid $11.98 for two large bags plus 2 pacifier bags, which IMO is a better deal than the $10.99 large bag 2-pack.  I wanted a way to hold pacifiers, and at $3-$8 each, I thought pacifier cases were the biggest ripoff.  This set is so worth it.  The blue and the green neutral prints are really cute!  I'm buying more of these sets for my pregnant sister and cousin. :)
