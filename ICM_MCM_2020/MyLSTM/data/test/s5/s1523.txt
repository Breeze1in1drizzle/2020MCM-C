I had a small paint chip on the inside that would spark because bare metal was exposed. A couple of coats of this paint saved the day. It has a use that is far more than cosmetic. It saved me about $175 because I did not have to buy a replacement microwave of similar quality because I did not trust using a paint that was not microwave friendly.
