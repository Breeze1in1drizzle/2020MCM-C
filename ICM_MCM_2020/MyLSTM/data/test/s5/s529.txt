I purchased the FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 six months ago, and it was love at first blowdry. During high school and college, I owned a series of inexpensive, low quality hair dryers. Yes, after half an hour or more and some expletives, they did dry my hair, but it was always flat and without shine. I blamed my hair, rather than the hair dryers.<br /><br />At the warm heat setting and high fan setting, this FHI hair dryer gives me soft, voluminous waves in less than fifteen minutes. I never knew my hair could look so beautiful and healthy! I blow dry it immediately after every morning shower, and I use [[ASIN:B004461ZL4 Sedu Anti-Frizz Polishing Treatment with Argan Oil, 6.8 oz. bottle]].<br /><br />Oh, and I almost forgot! The first time I turned it on, I thought I had received a defective model like some of the other reviewers. But I had accidentally pressed the blue cold shot button found on the inside of the hair dryer handle.<br /><br />UPDATE (after one year): I still love this hair dryer, and it's working just as well as the day I purchased it.
