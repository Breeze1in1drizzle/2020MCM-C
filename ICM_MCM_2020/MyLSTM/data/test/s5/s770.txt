I have been using this blow dryer for about 2 months now and I love it.  It dries my hair very quickly and the attachments stay put and do not fall off.  I can understand why some of the other reviews say the cool button gets in the way.  When I first starting using the dryer, I accidentally hit the cool button but I have easily adjusted how I hold the dryer so this no longer happens.  That would be my only complaint with the dryer.  Other than that, I love it - my hair looks great, it takes me much less time to dry my hair, and it's not too heavy.  I am happy with my purchase.
