I exclusively breastfeed my 6 week old and we had been having huge problems between latch and gas/colic, my baby was miserable and would cry constantly.  As a last ditch effort I decided to try pumping, but my little one refused to take the medela bottles we had. I found this set at Walmart in white and figured it was worth a try since my son takes the MAM paci. He took the bottle instantly and I've loved them since. Here is my breakdown of pros and cons<br />PROS: - the vented bottle does help with gas, its like I have a whole new baby and we are getting to enjoy the smiles that we love to see! Note: he still has gas but there is a marked change in how he handles it grunts vs. Crying and screaming<br />- the nipple shape is easy for him to use and doesn't seem to bother him switching from the bottle to me when I want him to nurse.<br />-the sterilization feature is awesome! I didn't want to buy one of those bulky sterilizers and I'm busy enough as it is with my family and baby, so 3 minutes in the microwave and done!<br />- super easy to clean! These things come completely apart in 5 larger pieces, it takes no time to clean and I know I didn't miss anything<br />- they are easy to re-assemble, just pop the silicon ring into the base, screw on the body (make sure the threads are right and its tight to prevent leaks) pop nipple into neck then screw onto top! I found these much more user friendly than other anti-colic bottles. Even my beloved Born Free that I used for my first son can't stand up to the MAM.<br />-did I mention they have helped the gas issue?  Because that's the most important part for me :)<br />-I like how much this set comes with for the low price, I should note the pacis are 2+ month so they may be a little big for newborns.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-they can leak, most of the time its user error,  note what I said early about watching the threads, I have done it a few times and accidentally dumped half the bottle on me and the baby, but once I figured out what I was doing wrong I've had no more leaks.  If you are super groggy at night, you may want to have some bottles already put together so you don't have to worry about it.<br />- I wouldn't heat liquid in them. My hubby has with no issues,  but I just don't trust it. Its easier for me to reheat the bottle that I pumped in and pour the liquid into these. Besides the wide bottom doesn't fit in some warmers.<br />-the numbers aren't the easiest to read especially if you care about anything less than 2 ounces.  For me, this hasn't been an issue to cause much concern.<br /><br />Overall I love the bottles, they are cute and more functional than I could hope! Amazon does seem to have the best price,  so I intend to purchase extras here
