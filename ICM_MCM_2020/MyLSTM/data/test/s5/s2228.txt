I have use these with 2 of my 4 children and am pregnant now...due today actually...and plan to use these again!<br />Coming from a breastfeeding mom, I personally am not too concerned with if it is &#34;orthodontic&#34; or not. I know that sounds bad but this is why.... Nipple confusion! These closely resemble mom's and also resemble how most breast milk bottles are shaped. I don't let my babies hold on to a pacifier too long anyway so the &#34;orthodontic&#34; aspect doesn't really apply. Even if you're formula feeding, most of the bottles like Avent, Gerber or even Medela and other popular brands of bottles are still shaped the same.<br />In the other reviews I read, I saw a lot of moms have a problem finding pacifier clips or holders that fit.<br />Here's a solution..!<br />I haven't found any that hold these except the ones specially designed for Soothies. They have some by Booginhead that have a loop you saddle tie through the holes on the base. I, personally, dont care for these the way they suggest to use them. The loop rubs against baby's face and sits right where their mouth is wet. Just makes for a chapped face waiting to happen. SO, my solution, I used my husbands drill and drilled a hole in the tab and looped a Booginhead through that. Im sure you could use anything to put the hold there. If you do this, make sure its a SMALL hole and its low enough down to the base you dont have to worry about it breaking.<br />There are also some by Bella Tunno or Ulububu that clips on the tab. These don't hold too well but I guess its personal preference if you want a clip that slips or a loop that can chap :D<br />Personally, I think Soothie should put a hole in the tab themselves. :) Problem solved!<br />So, long and short of it, I think these are the best!!
