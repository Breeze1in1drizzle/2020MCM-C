I bought this for my 2 month old who hated being in his car seat and in the back seat by himself. What a Life Saver!!!<br />I don't have to play...Where is the binky game?! and now my son loves staring and talking stories to his monkey friend. I totally adore it and no more car rides with an upset baby! It has made my car rides a lot easier and so pleasant. I plan on getting the Frog for his bouncer...Its an Awesome product...Get it...You won't regret it!
