The 1st pacifier my daughter was given was the hospital pacifier- which made it very difficult to get her take anything else because of the different shapes.... My only problem with the hosp. pacifier is the shape- its round so when she got a cold it blocked her nose and the shape of these pacifiers are great! They let her breath and she absolutely loves them! I highly reccommend them to everyone I know that has a new baby!
