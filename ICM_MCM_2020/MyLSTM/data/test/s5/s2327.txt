I love these! I have used them for my baby since he was about a month old. He is almost 5 months old now. They seem to work great! I love the size. I tried a few other brands and my baby just would not take them. They were all too long or the shape was one he didn't like. These seem to be the shape and length that he likes. I actually bought a ton of these because the baby kept dropping them everywhere. I seriously will not buy any other kind. They don't have these in the store so I have to purchase them on Amazon and just wait for them to be shipped. I will be using these for my next babies for sure.
