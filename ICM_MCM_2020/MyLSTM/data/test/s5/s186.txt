I bought this hair dryer to replace my previous Hot Tools hair dryer that had broken after many years of use. This hair dryer is even better than my old one! It is much lighter and still has the same fast drying power of the last one. I take it everywhere because no other hair dryer can dry my long layered hair as quickly and easily.
