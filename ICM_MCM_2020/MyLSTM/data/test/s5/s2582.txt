My breast fed baby will ONLY take these.  I wasted a lot of money on several brands of pacifier and gave up, thinking my baby just wouldn't take one.  My niece was born the following week, and one night in the middle of the night I was messaging with my sister-in-law and she messaged me a picture of the MAM, the pacifier that my niece had started taking reliably.  I thought, whatever, it probably still won't work, but we bought some anyway, and lo and behold!!!  So now we have three sets, pink, yellow, and the green glow in the dark.  We also have the 6 mos ones in a drawer ready to go, which are the same but with a longer nipple.  Love our MAM!!!
