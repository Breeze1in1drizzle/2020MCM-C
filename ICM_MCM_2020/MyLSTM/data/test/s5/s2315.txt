I wasn't sure about pacifiers, but got this from a ecostore that was closing down before my child arrived and when she seemed colicky and as I read/viewed Happiest Baby on Block, I decided to dig it out of all the new baby stuff.  she isn't a big pacifier girl, but as we struggled with colicky type symptoms, I also got the traditional paci from the store.  she definitely prefers this one to the others.  it seems yesterday we dropped/lost it.  hence, I am here trying to figure out what to do to replace it.
