I first saw this a couple months ago - my new hairdresser was using it. It was very quiet, despite the Ferrari engine printed on the side! I commented and they were selling them there: $260 for a $400 hairdryer.  Seemed like a deal, but a lot for a hairdryer, so I went online and found it here for $162.  It's powerful but gentle, I don't smell hair burning like with cheaper hairdryers.  The only possible negative you should know is that it's a little heavy, heavier than I'm used to with the $20 cheapo ones from Marshalls, anyway!  But I don't care - I love it.
