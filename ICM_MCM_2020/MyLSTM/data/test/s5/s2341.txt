Babies need to suck to soothe themselves. The hospital gave us one of these and told us pacifiers also can prevent SIDS. Our baby loves this pacifier and we have given it to him since day one. I am breastfeeding and he has not had any nipple confusion. Make sure you have enough before you get home!
