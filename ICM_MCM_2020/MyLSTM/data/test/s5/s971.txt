I bought this because I just moved and have been using my sister's hair dryer up to this point. I couldn't afford to spend a lot of extra money and I am already purchasing a million things for my new apartment, but being a female with thick, long hair and bangs, I *needed* a hair dryer. I was skeptical to purchase something so cheap, but really: WOW. This is perfect for me. It blows strongly on high, the heat is quite warm, and the cold setting is fantastic.<br /><br />I bought this for $8 and am SO happy about it. Don't waste your money on a more expensive one. I really don't see the point.
