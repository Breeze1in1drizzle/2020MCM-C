I got this for my new 1/1 apartment in the city.  I'm so in love with it.....<br />*Easy set up<br />*Perfect for small spaces<br />*Works amazing<br />*My coffee/food gets super hot<br />*Price is affordable better then the high priced ones<br />* Stainless look, classic (easy clean up)<br />I honestly don't have anything negative to say about it.
