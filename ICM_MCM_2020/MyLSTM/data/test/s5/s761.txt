I used this dryer in Italy. They have a higher current, so I'm glad I read the directions. I set the dial to the correct current, and only used low setting. It was quite powerful, and dried my hair in an equal amount of time as my full sized dryer at home.<br />Also, it comes with a little diffuser that works well. How cute!
