The Andis 33805 Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer is a great little personal grooming appliance.  It has two settings: Low and High.  I use High almost exclusively, even though I have fine, short, grey hair because I don't like to dawdle over grooming in the morning.  Its dual voltage selections (125V/250V) would come in handy if travelling (with an added plug adapter).  High produces a rapid stream of air that quickly heats up and stays at a steady, moderately high temperature.  Low is appropriate if you spend more time styling with some degree of heat--producing a nice smooth and fuller result.  However, I'm a Type-A character who wants the job done pronto, so this is my machine of choice.  All dryers sound a little loud right in your own ear, but a family member says that the Andis is quieter than the Sunbeam I recently replaced.<br /><br />I bought this device to replace a Sunbeam compact dryer, which replaced another Sunbeam, which was preceded by at least two Conairs, and a parade of various compact (mostly) dryers over the last 32 years.  This is the BEST of the lot.  I actually gambled and bought two at once because compact dryers are getting hard to find now, and my confidence has been rewarded.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quick solution to get going in the morning after your shower, look no further.  This one's a winner!
