I have a hair dryer with higher wattage than this one.  It keeps overheating and switching to cold air.  When it cools down, it goes back to hot.  It takes forever to dry my hair as cold air does nothing.  I was in a hotel that had this hair dryer.  It's lower wattage, but it took less time to dry my hair because it did not overheat.  When I got home from vacation, I decided to see if I could find the same hair dryer on Amazon.  This is exactly the same one as in the hotel.  I ordered it.  I received it quickly.  I LOVE IT.  I love that it's mounted on the wall.  I love everything about this dryer.  Don't let the lower wattage fool you.  This seems as hot as my other dryer.  It must be a little less, because it never overheats, but you wouldn't notice it.  I can dry my hair faster with this dryer.
