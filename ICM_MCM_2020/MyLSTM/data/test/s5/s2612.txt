If your child loves their pacifier, then this is a must have item.  I have bought a lot of specialty baby items because they were supposed to be amazing and help their child develop and make parenting easier.  Most of the items I have gotten just sit in a box after being examined by the baby once and then tossed away in a fit of indifference.<br /><br />One thing that my baby has loved since day 2 has been a pacifier.  She is a big pacifier baby.  I learned quickly that even though young babies can't control their movements and can't throw things, a pacifier that just falls out of their mouth still has the ability to roll far enough away to never be found again.<br /><br />Wubbanubs actually solve this problem.  When a pacifier falls, it can't go far.  If it is thrown, it is easily found.  And when babies start being able to control their hands, they can grasp the stuffed animal and bring it to their mouth much earlier than they would be able to with just a normal pacifier.
