I bought these for my 4 month old son. He has loved the original Soothie, so I wanted to try these, the &#34;Super Soothie&#34; as they call it. They are stiffer and the rubber base is a bit thicker. He really enjoys them. I think they feel more like a finger (which is his usual preference if he can grab someone's hand!) He likes to switch between the softer and harder ones depending on his mood. I just wish they made the WubbaNubs with the option of this one.
