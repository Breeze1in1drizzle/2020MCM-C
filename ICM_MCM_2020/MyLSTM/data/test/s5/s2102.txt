My daughter has had this for two montha she absolutely loves it. We dont leave the house or go to daycare without it. We even bought an extra for just in case<br /><br />Update: My daughter is now almost 18 months old and we don't go anywhere without her &#34;bug&#34; as she calls him we have gone through two. Not because of her but our dog decided to give it a try also. She loves him so much that before she pops him in her mouth for bed she gives his face a kiss. Best pacifier ever!! I will buy them for all my future kids and friends kids.
