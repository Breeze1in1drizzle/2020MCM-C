The Mangroomer aspect is more of a marketing thing than any realistic specification for this hairdryer. My wife loves this hairdryer and uses it all the time too. It pumps out plenty of heat on the highest setting. There are numerous options for temperature settings. I've never needed it, but I tried the cold air blast feature. This apparently sets your hair after it has been styled? I don't really understand that process, but if that's important to you - the feature does just what it says. I found that the hairdryer volume while running is pretty acceptable (not sure if I'm alone on this, but I hate really loud hair dryers). The design is attractive and I guess a little manlier than the standard hairdryer? I don't know, grasping for reasons why this is a mangroomer specifically, but yeah it looks pretty cool and not feminine. But I think you'd have to be pretty insecure to be weirded out using a feminine hairdryer anyway. I think the Negative Ion stuff is hogwash, but hey I'm not a hair scientist. Bottom line: this hairdryer makes wet hair dry.
