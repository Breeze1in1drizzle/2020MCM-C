As a hairstylist I have used MANY drying tools and NOTHING compares to this dryer.  I will never use another the famous CHI including.  CHI doesn't come close to this one!!!! And the cost you just can't beat it.  I had ,my first twinturbo for about 10 years roughly, It hasn't completely quit on me yet but showing signs of getting tired so I'm buying another because I will NOT work without this dryer.  It will not disappoint....HINT  NOTHING manages frizz except products.  So don't think a dryer is going to eliminate frizz because that's nonsense.
