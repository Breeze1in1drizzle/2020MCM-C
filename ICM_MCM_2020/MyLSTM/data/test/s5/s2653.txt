I performed baby sitting duty with my newest grandchild this evening. I must say that this is a clever idea.......to actually create a pacifier for an infant's sweet and tiny little mouth. She latched onto this immediately and was very comfortable. The pacifier didn't obstruct her nose and before much time passed she fell asleep. When she woke up for her feeding she took to her bottle and was rocked in a cradle for a bit with the pacifier securely placed in her mouth.<br />I personally love the compact design and the quality materials used in this item. It doesn't have a funky rubbery smell and is easy to both clean and air dry. Great idea to put an infant at ease......a baby will take to this and isn't likely to drop this  as easily as a traditional nipple that is heavy, large, and cumbersome.
