My husband and I were so afraid to offer a pacifier given how hard I was working on establishing breastfeeding. However, our little girl has such a strong suck reflex and need for comfort that it was best for her. This was the only brand that she would touch. We tried five others and she spit them out. The size is amazing for newborns. She is 6 weeks and still uses it. There has been no nipple confusion at all with this. We are so grateful and highly recommend these!
