The hair dryer has a number of settings and will allow you to have very cool air or very hot air.  It is quite powerful and gets my long hair dry in less time than other dryers I have had in the past.  It is a little heavy and I definitely would not refer to it as compact - it's about the same size as a standard dryer you might get at a drug store and it's heavier as well.  Overall, I'm very pleased with it and hope it lasts a very long time.
