This was to be a replacement for a Sunbeam dryer we had in our home which is now working. Surprise!  We arenow  thinking of putting it in our vacation condo.  These dryers are absolutely excellent and we will buy another as a backup in case you all stop manufacturing them.  Highly recommend this product!
