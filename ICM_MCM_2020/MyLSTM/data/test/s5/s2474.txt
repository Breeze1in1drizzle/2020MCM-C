I can never have enough of these on hand. I keep four of them around for my twins. I love that they help stay put with infants and they additionally seem to be soothing and give them something to grab on to. Also a lot harder to lose, and a lot easier to find in a diaper bag full of stuff! A must have for a shower gift.
