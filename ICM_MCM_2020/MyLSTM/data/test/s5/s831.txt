My hair is very thick and coarse and used to take forever to dry.  I inquired to my hairdresser about higher wattage dryers and you would think I asked her how to find the holy grail!  Well, wonder no more -- you can get a honking, high-wattage blow dryer right here on Amazon.  It's a little pricey, but isn't your time worth something?
