These are the only pacifiers that our baby liked and can keep in her mouth. I know a lot of people don't like how they have to be right side up, but that never really bothered us. Not only does the picture show which way is up, the shape of the paci itself is another indicator. Sometime our baby puts it in herself upside down, but it doesn't bother her... or she'll turn it the other way herself.
