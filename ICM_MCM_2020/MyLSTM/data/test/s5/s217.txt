Best hair dryer I have ever used!  I bought it b/c I used it at a hotel and I love it!  I have had it for about a month and it works great.  It dries hair quickly, but is gentle and doesn't damage my hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a hair dryer that is great for your hair,!
