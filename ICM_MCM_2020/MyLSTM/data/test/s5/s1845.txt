My son just hit 4 months. He's been teething up a storm. He always trys to chew on the sides of his paci so this is perfect. His paci with more teething space! I popped that puppy out of the package and right away he was interested in it. I can't believe how expensive some teethers are. This is simple and cute. It looks great with the soothie paci holder.
