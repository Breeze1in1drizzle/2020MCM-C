I did a LOT of research for a trip to England/Scotland I was using this for. I had no problems at all with this, it was light and compact, perfect to cram into an already full suitcase. PLEASE NOTE- this hairdryer is necessary to have dual voltage (they use other voltage there) BUT you still need an actual wall converter so it will fit into their plugs!! This only allows you to change the voltage so that the normal hair dryer you use in the States won't fry your head or die on you, a wall converter is very cheap (about $8 and can be bought almost anywhere). I used the wall converter for multiple appliances (phone charger, etc.) but you need to check voltage on other appliances as well.
