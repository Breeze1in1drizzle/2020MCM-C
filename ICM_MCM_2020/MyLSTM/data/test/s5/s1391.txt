i love the cord keeper Conair dryers.  Much easier to store.  My old Conair cord keeper (less expensive, 2 speed, 2 heat settings) wore out at the plug.  Couldn't be without a blow dryer so looked to trusty Amazon.  I saw this model and read the reviews.  I liked that it had a cool setting and didn't have to keep,the button pushed for the cool shot.  I also like that it has the cord keeper.  But the best feature about it, in my opinion, is that it is MUCH QUIETER than the less expensive model.  I get ready for work in the early mornings and this model produces a moderate hum, compared to the blasting roar the cheaper model makes.  If a quieter blow dryer is what you're looking for, with 1875 power, this is your dryer.  Worth the extra money!!!  Buy it, you won't be sorry!  Super fast delivery!  Ps, use the concentrator nozzle, cuts down on frizz.
