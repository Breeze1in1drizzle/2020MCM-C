With a four year warranty I had to try it and now I'm in love. It doesn't take an hour for me to dry my hair..WITHOUT blowing all of my curls apart in a big frizzy mess. It is one of the lightest full size hair dryers that I've owned. It is reasonably quiet and the buttons are in the right spot and don't accidentally turn on and off while drying. I have long permed curls and having a good hair dryer can make or break my day. After MANY throw away dryers I think I have found a new best friend.
