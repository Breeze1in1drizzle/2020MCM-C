My hair is very dense and attracts static VERY quickly.  My usual blowdryer (and all the others I've owned in the past) left my hair dry but pieces of my hair sticking straight up and I'd always have to use a smoother to tame them.  Thankfully I showered at a friend's house one day and borrowed this dryer.  I came out of the bathroom and my friend was like OMG YOUR HAIR LOOKS AMAZING.  No flyaways.  No static.  My hair looked better after JUST DRYING IT than it usually did after I spent 30 minutes styling it.<br /><br />I immediately ordered this on Amazon Prime ten minutes later and tossed my old dryer as soon as it came in.  I have since bought two more for my best friends, and they swear by it as well.
