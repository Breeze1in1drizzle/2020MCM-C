We opted for this style of microwave this time around in our new kitchen and have not been disappointed! The shipping was fast (thanks to Amazon), the look of the microwave is wonderful and goes well with our other appliances (GE Monogram & DCS), the drawer opens and closes well, it cooks wonderfully, it's quiet, controls are simple to use, the kitchen timer is handy...I know there were some negative posts, but as of now, after 4 months of use, I couldn't be happier!
