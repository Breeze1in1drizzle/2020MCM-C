Another device that is a powerhouse in a small package.  I had a very expensive white designer hairdresser before this and it still took forever to dry hair, and got so hot doing so that kids and pets yowl.  This dryer works in record time, blows the moisture out like those car dryer things at the car wash, and doesn't burn hair or scalp doing so.  It is also fairly quiet for the power.  I am not a pro hairdresser so can't speak for that, but for the family bath night, it is fast without the  furious.
