I just really like this hairdryer.  In fact, I purchased this item to replace the exact same hairdryer, which I had for probably about five years before it finally fizzled out.  It's comfortable to hold, it dries my long, thick hair quickly (no easy feat), and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  I initially replaced my old hairdryer with a different (more expensive) ionic hairdryer, and didn't get the same results.  So I looked for an exact replacement on Amazon, and was pleasantly surprised to find it, not to mention at such a good price.  Needless to say, I didn't hesitate to click the &#34;Buy now with 1-Click&#34; button, and I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Tourmaline Ceramic technology - emits infrared heat and negative ions, which makes it gentler on hair and faster drying<br />Lightweight, comfortable to hold and use<br />Long cord<br />Foldable - packs and stores easily and compactly<br /><br />CONS:<br />Doesn't have separate heat and speed settings<br />The on/off switch is a little difficult to use<br />Doesn't have a retractable cord
