I have used MAM pacifiers with all three of my babies.  I really like that they fit perfectly around their tiny faces, and that they vent, so baby's skin doesn't get irritated.  The only thing I wish was different was the color options when purchasing.  I chose blue, but got green ones.  Not a big deal though.  Also, these pacifiers do not come with any case to store and keep clean, as some other brands do.
