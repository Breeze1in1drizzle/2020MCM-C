I purchased this for our Nuby Soothie pacifiers. I read the reviews and was a bit concerned with many reviews saying that it was very difficult to open, some saying impossible. I was concerned as I have Fibromyalgia and can hardly open jars, heavy doors and other things with my hands. I took the chance and bought one, hey it was only $3.99 with free shipping! When I received the case I immediately went to open it with the provided latch and yes it was difficult but I found a more than easier way to open the case. If you squeeze the two sides of the case, it instantly pops open. I barely have to put pressure on the case and its quickly open. Yes, I realize the latch should be easy to open but I found this way worked and seems to be a great way. This easily fits two soothie pacifiers in the case. The clip is a little flimsy but I believe it's made that way so you can clip it on nearly anywhere. I think an improvement would be an actual caribeanner clip to ensure it doesn't fall off. Although I have not had the problem of it falling off. It's so wonderful I purchased another one!
