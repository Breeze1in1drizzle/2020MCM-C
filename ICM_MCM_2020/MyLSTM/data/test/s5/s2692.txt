baby really likes these. he sucks/chews on the pacifier but also on the hard plastic part when teething. as advertised, the pacifier does close when it hits the floor. once it closes, however, baby can't get it open on his own. if your baby likes to play the game of throwing things down, it will close and you will have to open it again for him. the different faces are cute. we have the clown and the penguin.
