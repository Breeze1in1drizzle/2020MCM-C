I'll keep it brief.  I had resigned myself to the fact that my daughter was just one of those babies that doesn't like pacifiers.  We had tried literally 5 other brands of pacifiers before the binky, and i really wish I'd just bought this one first.  With every other pacifier, she would make this disgusted face, and nearly spit it out of her mouth.  Imagine my surprise, when, at 3 months old, I gave her the binky, and she sucked away happily.  I thought maybe it was a fluke at first, but it always stops her crying.  It's a godsend!
