When I first saw these I thought they were a little goofy.  I got this for my daughter, who was 6 months at the time & she loves it.  We take it everywhere.  Usually she sucks on the pacifier, but sometimes she chews on his legs or the tags, or just throws him around.  I've washed it in the washer a couple of times and it has held up well.  After 3 months of daily use there is no sign that the pacifier is anywhere close to detaching.  The lamb is small enough that I feel safe putting it in her bed with her to hold onto while she sleeps.
