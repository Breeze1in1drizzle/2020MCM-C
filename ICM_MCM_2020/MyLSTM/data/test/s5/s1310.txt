Wonderful hair dryer.  I bought this one for my camper and after using it I put my more expensive one in the camper and brought this one in the house. It dries my long hair much faster and somehow leaves it less frizzy.  I was skeptical of the ionic feature but after using it I will not use anything else.  I love it!
