I bought this dryer for my girlfriend for her birthday last year because she is always complaining about getting her hair done and how much people charge her (which I end up paying for anyway) so I thought what better thing to buy her for her birthday than something she can use and benefit from forever. She loves this hair dryer, she puts her hair in rollers and sits under. It gets very hot too! Thanks for the great buy!
