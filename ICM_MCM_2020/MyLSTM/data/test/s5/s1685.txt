Everything we wanted in a microwave.  All black looks better than just black face.  Has the 30-second add-on feature which we both like.  Slides around, but that can be remedied with non-slip material.  Has a nice &#34;lip&#34; at bottom so can be clasped while pressing buttons or starting which prevents slipping in the first place.  Great price for product--but time will tell for sure.
