Great in helping to keep her Ci-Ci in her mouth with just a little weight to keep it from falling out. It helps if she puts her arm or hand behind its head and a gentle fall out of her mouth is quickly recovered but it doesn't survive a spit out or quick fall out---still great! One less time to reach over to put it in. I'd say it helped to keep it in 30% more than without. It also is great for her to snuggle and suck to soothe! Definitely helps that soothies are one of her favorites too. Great! Soft! Comforting in more ways than 1!
