I have fine dry frizzy hair, not straight not wavy. I used cheap dryers before and was very skeptical that any expensive dryer can make any difference. But I was wrong, this dryer DOES make a difference. With FHI Heat Nano it takes me just under 5 minutes to dry my hair and as result my hair looks great: it gives volume (with no gels or mousses), remove frizz and make it straight (with no iron).   Highly recommend this product.
