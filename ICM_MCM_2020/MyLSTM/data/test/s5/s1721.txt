I just bought a bunch of these because they're difficult to find in stores now.  This is our third child to use this pacifier.  My first and third son use/used these exclusively.  My second son preferred another brand but would use these in a pinch.  I have tried many other brands and these stay in better than any pacifier we have tried.
