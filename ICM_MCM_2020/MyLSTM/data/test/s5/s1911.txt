These pacifier wipes are great.  We initially received as a shower gift and bought more when we ran out.  They are great for cleaning a pacifier that was either dropped on the ground, thrown in a diaper bag with other stuff, etc.  The smell is very pleasant, not harsh or alcohol-smelling, safe for baby to immediately use after wiping.  Highly recommend!
