So...my girlfriend has this really super thick, straight, shiny, enviable mane of dark red, beautiful butt-length hair.  She mantains it so thoroughly and with so much detail, her daily routine usually takes substantial effort and time.<br /><br />With our old high end hair dryer I started referring to this ritual of hers as Hairnobyl because it raised the temperature of the bathroom 20 degrees, dimmed the lights, made me turn up the TV really loud, the dogs would hide in other rooms and communication was impossible (her mouth would move...but...).  After the 30 minutes of excruciating noise I was climbing the wall...not to mention a repetitive-use shoulder pain she developed.<br /><br />Then I bought her this dryer.<br /><br />Her shoulder feels better because it's so much lighter, and it takes about half the time.  It is also more effective...makes her hair really shiny.<br /><br />We now own two of these...they are great!  She's an expert, and when she raves about a hair product...trust me...it is WIN!
