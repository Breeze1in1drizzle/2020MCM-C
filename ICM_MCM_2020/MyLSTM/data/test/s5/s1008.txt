I bought this same dryer 8 years ago and absolutely loved it.  When friends would use it, they'd always wanted to know where I got it but it had been so long that I forgot.  When it blew out (because I dropped the power cord hard on the floor for many'o years) I knew I had to replace it.  I searched for it on Amazon and sure enough, they had it and you can't beat the price.  It's quiet and does a great job on long hair.
