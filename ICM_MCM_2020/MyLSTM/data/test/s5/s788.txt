We have been looking for this style of hair dryer for some time.  A similar but different brand dryer from local store was disappointing; loud, strong vibration, poorly made.  We have been very pleased with the well made Andis dryer after several weeks of use.  It is quiet, vibration free, well made with a long cord.
