I love this hair dryer. It dries my hair quickly, and my hair dries very smooth and soft. I had an issue with the cord of mine not staying locked, but I was able to easily exchange it for the same hair dryer which did not have the locking problem. Must have been a fluke, but it was very easy to return!
