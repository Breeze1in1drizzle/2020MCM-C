Love the holiday moose. The plaid accents are really cute, and this one feels slightly higher quality construction compared to the already high quality of other Wubbanubs. Purchased as a replacement to our first Wubbanub which lasted nearly 8 months of hard usage. If you don't have a Wubbanub, I strongly recommend them for babies.
