Switched to these pacis after using the other Nuk made out of the hard plastic on the outside. Our daughter doesn't get those marks on her cheeks now because of how nice and flexible these are. Also, this doesn't have that big ring on the outside, so it's harder for her to accidentally pull it out and saves her that frustration. And, because it's basically all one piece, there aren't those nooks and crannies for fuzz and stuff to get caught, which makes cleaning them much easier.
