This pacifier is an alternative to the soothie, with the same nipple, but a better base design.  I love the product because my baby does too.  I received ours from the hospital and promptly bought more from the actual company at $1.75 for one, or for $10.50 you get 7.  It seems to be a lot better deal to me...
