My daughter refused every other pacifier until I found these.  I also use the playtex drop ins for bottles which most simulates the nipples for breastfeeding and so do these pacifiers.  My daughter has a tiny mouth and love, love, loves these!  We got a sample with the playtex bottle kit and ordered some on line asap!  Hard to find in the stores.
