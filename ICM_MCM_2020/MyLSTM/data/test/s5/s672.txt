I actually ordered this for my sister. She lives in the Houston area and has very thick, frizzy hair and all the hair dryers we tried locally really just didn't do the trick. This dryer is hot (but not to hot) and blows very strongly and allows her to dry her hair quickly before she gets too hot herself. Good product.
