We have used the WubbaNub pacifier since the day our baby girl was born and she took to it immediately. Because she is a breastfed baby, we weren't sure if a pacifier would hinder her ability to breastfeed properly. We gave her the WubbaNub anyways, it was too cute not to try! She has never had &#34;nipple confusion&#34;. She enjoyed her &#34;Mr. Binks&#34; as well lovingly call it, and it has become her comfort item. I've listed the pro's and con's below.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-The stuffed animal attached to the pacifier keeps it from getting lost when it falls out of baby's mouth. Many a times, I've been driving when it falls out of the baby's mouth and I can easily reach back and find it because of the stuffed animal being attached.<br />-Baby &#34;pets&#34; the animal during sleep transitions to sooth herself to sleep<br />-Lays flat on baby's chest, keeping it in their mouth even when they are newborn and don't have great &#34;suction&#34; yet<br />-Many different stuffed animal options and they are all so cute<br />-difficult to lose because of the size (they don't fall out and disappear under the couch!)<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Difficult to wash just the pacifier<br />-Wish the pacifier was detachable so that it could be swapped out for the different stages<br /><br />Overall, our baby has loved this pacifier from day one. We don't have many complaints and I love that we get so many compliments on how cute it is!
