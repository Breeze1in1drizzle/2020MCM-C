I have naturally curly hair and this hairdryer plus the diffuser have really brought out my curls! I love it! I use the setting below the high setting and then put it on cooler air as I am finishing up. I leave it a little bit damp. My hair is never frizzy with this hairdryer. The only thing I don't like about this hair dryer is the cord. It is not very long. I would recommend this hair dryer, especially if you have curly hair and like the use the diffuser. The price is not bad as it does include 2 attachments (the diffuser and another one to localize the airflow). I would purchase this again, but another 18 inches of cord would be nice.
