When our daughter was under 2 months, she was FUSSY and we were willing to try ANYthing to get her and keep her asleep. Friends recommended a pacifier, but she was so little (6 pounds at birth), she couldn't keep a pacifier in her mouth, and if she lost it, that only made her 1000 times fussier. And then we found the wubbanub. Even when she was very young, she could hold onto this pacifier. She loves the pattern, and she enjoys chewing on all parts of it. It's also easy to find, and hard to lose - a winning combo. There's something extra special about the giraffe. We have a little duck wubbanub too, but the horns on the giraffe and the weight of the feet just make it perfect somehow....Whoever invented these is genius. Also, if you are concerned, the wubbanub is light enough that a baby can easily move it, so you don't have to worry about a suffocating/choking hazard.
