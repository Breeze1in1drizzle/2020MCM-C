our baby is 35 weeks corrected (he was born premature at 31 weeks) and he has been using this for over a week since he came home from the nicu and the binki that comes attached is JUST LIKE the soothie binkis they use in the hospital so he took to it right away! we love it. he's able to hold it all by him self and he's only 5lbs still! I would soo recomend this paci for any baby! and the extra paci's are super cheap! we bought it straight from pacimals.com and only spent $28 after shipping and taxes and got toutou the dog plus 3 paci's that attach right on. I wouldn't recomend using the adaptor and other paci brands I would just stick with the kind that were made for it. I included a photo of my little man in the pictures at the top with mr. toutou.
