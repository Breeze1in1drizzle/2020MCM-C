I got this hair dryer b/c I wanted a no-frills, sturdy hairdryer, and that's exactly what I got. It performs exceptionally well and I have even dried - wait for it - CHICKENS w/ it outside. It's that sturdy. :) B/c I'm a woman I'm not using the little blue button; regardless, this is an awesome piece of equipment.
