My daughter has loved her lamb WubbaNub. It was easy for her to grab when she was younger and it didn't bounce all around when it fell on the floor. She is 20 months now and just uses it at night to help her get to sleep. Per the warnings on it you need to be careful once they have teeth as if they use it as a teether (as my daughter began to do) the end will break off and can be a choking hazard.
