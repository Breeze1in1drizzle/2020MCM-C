Conair is a great brand for hair dryers. My previous one was still going after 8 years but figured it was just time for an upgrade! This hair dryer is GREAT: heats up quickly, dries hair fast and really does have a comfortable grip. The cool air button gets cold fast too, and it's not very loud, even on high. Great quality product for the price!
