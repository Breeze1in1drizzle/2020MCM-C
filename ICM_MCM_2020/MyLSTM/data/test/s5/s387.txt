I bought this hair dryer to replace one that I borrowed from a friend that burnt out because I used the electric converter incorrectly. Because the price was so reasonable and because I had to reach $25 for free shipping, I bought two and kept one for myself. I use this dryer every day and couldn't be happier with it. My hair is somewhat long (little below shoulders) and this dryer is light, powerful, and drys my hair quickly. It would make a terrific travel dryer. It works much better than those found in most hotel rooms. At this price you can't go wrong. The fact that it has the dual voltage is a nice plus.
