My daughter wanted to constantly use me as her pacifier and I tried every pacifier in the store but she wouldn't latch on to any of them for more than a few seconds.  I read the reviews and decided to order a few of these so that maybe I could get a few hours of sleep instead of having her 'nurse' off me all night.  They worked wonders!  These are the only pacifiers she will use.  They are lightweight, which is great b/c they're less likely to wake her up by falling out of her mouth once she's asleep.  Plus they are very bendable so if she is asleep on her side they won't put too much pressure on her little face.  Thanks Hawaii Medical!
