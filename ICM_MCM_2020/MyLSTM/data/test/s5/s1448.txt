Love it! Love it! Love it!  My Sharp microwave of 10 years finally died.  It had survived numerous moves and the door was actually held on by strapping tape.  We looked around at other microwaves and found we couldn't beat the price for all the features offered by this model from.  This one was built with the same quality as my old one and I don't doubt it will last as long.
