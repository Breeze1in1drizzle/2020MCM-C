My son tried 6 different pacifier brands and this was the only one he would use. I've purchased close to 100 of them in the last year, since we lose them like crazy. Sigh. Anyway, when he needs a pacifier, it's desperate, so we have them all over the house now. I like that these are mostly clear, so we can still see his happy little smirk through the pacifier. And they aren't too distracting in photos, etc. They come in a variety of colors, and we have just about every one of them. I would definitely recommend them, however, it's really up to your baby and their preference. The pricing on Amazon is pretty consistent with Target pricing.
