We have purchased the alligator (which my dog decided was his chew toy), the giraffe, and the longhorn. I like the longhorn and the puppy the best. The giraffe's neck makes it a little less stable than the animals with the normal necks. We have yet to lose one of these because they're very visible, and my son loves the soft animal to grasp. Such a great invention! I make sure to have one with us at all times. The weight of the animals make them stay in place more than traditional pacifiers. They are also to clean (machine washable) and air dry very quickly. Don't hesitate to buy this-your baby will love it!
