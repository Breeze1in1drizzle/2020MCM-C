MAM pacifiers are the only kind my kiddo will take!  I like these because when he inevitably spits it out at night it's still glowing - I can see it and pop it back in before he starts to fuss. I really like the sterilizer box MAM pacifiers are packaged in as well.  I usually sanitize them once a week.  Very convenient.
