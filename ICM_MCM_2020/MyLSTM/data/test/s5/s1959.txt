We got this at the reccomendation of a Doctor in the PICU.  Our baby boy was always spitting out his paci on accident, or as a game.  The Wubbanub is the best thing since a bouncy seat.  The toy gives him something to hug while sucking his paci,and the added weight of the bear helps keeps the paci in his mouth.  And if the Paci drops it will not roll under furniture (Never good to have a screaming baby while parents are on hands and knees surching frantically for the paci).  I am thinking about getting another just to have a spare on hand because he is gonna love this one to bits.
