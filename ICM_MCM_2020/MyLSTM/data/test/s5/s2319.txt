This binky is pricey but a great alternative to all the plastic your baby is probably already sucking on.<br /><br />If your kid is around others who have similar binkies, though, you'll have to label this somehow. You could attach it to a clip, for example, or put a dot at the base in permanent marker. We've &#34;lost&#34; a bunch of these during childcare since they look so similar to other natural rubber ones.<br /><br />Another drawback: Drop it in the middle of the night, and you'll never find it. Good luck if you kick it with a toe while your baby is in your arms. It will find a way across the room to the point of no return until you put the baby down and turn all the lights on (maybe). Do they make glow-in-the-dark pacifier clips? If they do, they're probably toxic, and your baby shouldn't be in the crib with a binkie clip anyway.<br /><br />I still give this 5 stars because it's so well made and a great plastic alternative.
