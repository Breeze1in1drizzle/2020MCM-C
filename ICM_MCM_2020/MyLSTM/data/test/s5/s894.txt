i am a hair dresser in NYC. i typically need a new blow drier ever year or so. usually i buy this one. when i haven't and i have tried other driers (and there have been many!) they are never as good as this one. if you are shopping for an at home drier this will last forever. it is very light, its fast, its hot. you can turn the ionic function off (which if you have coarser frizzier hair that is what you need anyway). it is also pretty hardy. my tools get dropped all the time. other driers crack and stop working quickly, but not this one.   you can't go wrong here, and the diffuser that goes with this drier is really great too.  enjoy!
