Love these binkies! While my daughter prefers the orthodontic ones, I couldn't review the rounded for any lower because these pacifiers are truly remarkable. My daughter has a tied tongue, not enough to get it snipped but we tried every binky out there and at 3mos old, took the jump to try a 6mo & up size. What a world of difference! If your LO has latching issues with binkies, try a size up. Best advice I can give! She's 5mos now and still loves these.
