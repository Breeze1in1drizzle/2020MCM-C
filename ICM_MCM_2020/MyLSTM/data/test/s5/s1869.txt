Baby looks adorable using it, and it does what it's supposed to - it pacifies a baby.  Worth the buy just for the cute factor.    Now that she is grabbing, she will occasionally take hold of the stuffed-animal part and pull it out of her mouth.  That's your only look-out on this item.  You want to stay close by till the baby's asleep, so you can pop it back in her mouth if she tugs it loose.
