My newborn girl loves this pacifier.Â  The first time she tried it was at the hospital and they gave me 2 of them to take home, since the one they give are the standart blue with MAM written on it, I wanted something cute for my girl, so I bought from another brand that looked way nicer, but my baby wouldn't take it, so I checked online and found these and I love that they're exactly the same shape than the pacifier they gave me at the hospital but super cute.
