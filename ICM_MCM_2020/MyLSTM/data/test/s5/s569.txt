I bought this in order to smooth out the wrinkles of the 3M Indoor Window Insulator Kit, and it worked perfectly for that purpose, especially at the highest setting and with the concentrator nozzle attachment. It did not get super hot (which was good for the window kit), though I have no idea if that's good or bad from a hair drying perspective. I could have bought a cheaper hair dryer, but I chose this one because it is tourmaline ceramic, ionic, has several attachments, and multiple settings including a cool breeze setting -- all with the idea that after I was done using it on the window kit, I could provide it to female guests. This turned out to be a good idea, since my housemate's younger sister is currently visiting, and she was happy that I had a hair dryer for her to use. I asked for her opinion, and she says, &#34;It's great.&#34; Pressed for more details, she says, &#34;I like that it has a lot of different settings.&#34; As it turns out, this is in fact the first hair dryer she has ever used. So I might also recommend reading some of the other reviews... :)
