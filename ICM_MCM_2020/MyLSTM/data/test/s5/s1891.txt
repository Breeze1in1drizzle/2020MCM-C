This is a wonderful product.  My daughter likes this brand of pacifier, and the puppy really helps on a number of levels.  First, at 8 weeks, she can grab on to the puppy, helping to keep the paci in place.  Second, the puppy has saved the paci part from many falls (no 5 second rule needed).  Third, the dog sits on my daughter's chest while in her chair or in bed, so if she spits out the paci, it doesn't go far (and she is often able to retrieve it on her own).  Fourth, it's much harder to lose the paci when there is an adorable puppy attached.  The price is reasonable; the construction is very durable; and the dog is doggone cute.  This is our second  kid and our second round with Wubbanub infant pacifiers (animal + paci); they have a great selection and create a truly reliable product.
