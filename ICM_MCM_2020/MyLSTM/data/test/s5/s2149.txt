I purchased this product after using the Phillips Avent Soothie Pacifiers for my little daughter. They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute animal for girls or boys.<br />2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone.<br />3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth. She has also learned over time to guide it into her mouth on her own.<br />4. Durable - after several washes in the machine, it seems to be holding up just fine.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe.<br />2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning.
