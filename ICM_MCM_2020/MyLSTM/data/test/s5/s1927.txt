These are our favorite, after trying a few different styles. Why?<br />* The shield curves away from the face on the whole outer edge, so this pacifier doesn't leave an imprint on our baby's face as many other pacifiers do (e.g. NUK pacifiers).<br />* Stays in her mouth better than Soothies.<br />* Comes with a cover that keeps the pacifier clean when it's stuffed in a pocket or in her diaper bag.<br />* It's reversible, unlike the NUKs, so it's never upside-down in her mouth.<br />* The loop handle makes it easier for adults to pick up. Unfortunately, it also makes it easier for our baby to pull out of her mouth by accident.<br />* BPA-free, of course.
