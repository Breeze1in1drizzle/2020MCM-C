We love Wubbanubs in this house. The animals help weigh the pacifier down so it is much less likely to escape the child's reach, are a perfect fit for little hands to grip, and provide a source of amusement for young infants. Essential for car-rides and nap time. Plus, the animal makes it much easier for parents to spot as sometimes it seems like you never can find a pacifier when you need one.<br /><br />The only downside, is you cannot sterilize these like you would a loose pacifier. However, they do hold up rather well in the washing machine. And if your child becomes particularly attached to the animal, it is possible to remove the pacifier and stitch the open seam closed again.
