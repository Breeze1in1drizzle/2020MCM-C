Awesome product!  Just what I wanted.  I have medium length, thick, curly hair that takes forever to dry, and was looking for a small blow dryer with a diffuser.  I wanted the blow dryer to double for daily use and travel, so my items can be useful in all ways and save space since I live in a small home.  When I first received the product and removed it from the box, I was skeptical about its ability to dry hair.  It looks like a toy.  However, it has two speeds which are comparable to other blow dryers.  It works great.  I use it every day.  I love the bag which is stylish and easily holds all the accessories plus the dryer without problems.  Finally someone who makes a storage bag where the product actually fits once the consumer uses it. (Unlike tents that you can never stuff back into the bag once you unpack them.) I loved this product so much I bought one for a gift.
