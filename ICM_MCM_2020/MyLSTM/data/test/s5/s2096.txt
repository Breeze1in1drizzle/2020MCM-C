The only pacifier my son will take! It's easy to clean/keep clean and I have peace of mind knowing that it's made out of a really durable, natural material. The round nipple makes it so that the pacifier never slips out of his mouth, even when he's passed out. We love these pacifiers and get compliments on their appearance all the time! Perfect &#34;crunchy mom&#34; pacifier and my kiddo looks pretty darn cute with it. :)
