The reason that these pacifiers are advertised as being for children WITHOUT teeth has to do with the fact that they are made of soft plastic that can be chewed through and that babies with teeth (3 months and up) can possibly chew through them and maybe swallow the pieces. The company that manufactires them makes a sturdier rubber version that cannot be bitten through, called the Super Soothie. However, i tried buying them for my daughter and she HATED them and ONLY uses the Soothie (has never taken any other pacifier.) She LOVES them. She is 2 now so she is ready to gradually wean from the pacifier altogether. And yes she has chewed a hole in one or two of them but no harm done! But thats the reason why the company states that about the teeth. they Are NOT considered bad for your child's teeth and will be comparable in that way to any other pacifier out there.
