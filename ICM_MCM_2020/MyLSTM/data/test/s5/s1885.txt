My three month old son LOVES his Wubbanub!  He holds onto the stuffed puppy and is able to maneuver the pacifier into his mouth all on his own, which saves me from washing so many dropped pacifiers.  The stuffed animals are all really cute, and they are the perfect size for little hands to pick up and squeeze.  My son likes to hold onto his Wubba, pacifier within easy reach if he feels like sucking, while he swings and sleeps.  In fact, now that we have one, I am not sure I could get him to go to sleep without it!  I would recommend this to anyone with a little one that likes pacifiers.  Love it!
