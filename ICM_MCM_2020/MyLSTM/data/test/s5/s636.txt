Oh the power.  Oh the fast dry.  Oh the beauty of my hair when it is dry after 5 minutes!!!  I have extremely thick hair, and it typically takes 12-15 minutes to dry completely using a hair dryer.  My hair was dry and NOT frizzy after 5 minutes!  WHAT??!!  This dryer is very powerful, and high heat setting is enough to dry the hair but not make it smoking hot.  There is a reason this is rated as Amazon's #1 best selling hair dryer.
