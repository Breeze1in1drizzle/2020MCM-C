My son was a preemie, and the NICU gave him the GumDrop preemie and full-term pacifier to use during his long hospitalization -- he absolutely loved it! Designed by a medical company, and made of hospital-grade silicone, the GumDrop is lightweight, very soft, and features a unibody construction, so there are no parts that can come loose. The shape of the pacifier allowed him (and all the other preemies in the NICU) to use it in the side-lying position, even with all his tubes (i.e. CPAP, nasal cannula, nasal gavage tube, etc.). You can put your finger in the open end, allowing you to easily control or hold the pacifier; it also allows you to feel how strong your baby's suck is. NNS (non-nutritive sucking) is very important for a baby's development, and our baby got to practice a lot of NNS with his GumDrop. It helped him to self-soothe himself as well when we couldn't be at his cribside.     Following his discharge, I have purchased two full-term mango colored pacifiers for his use. The company has since introduced full-term pink and blue colored pacifiers, but I would purchase the mango colour again. Overall, I highly recommend this product. The price is great, although the S/H charges are high.
