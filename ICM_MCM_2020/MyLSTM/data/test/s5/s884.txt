I have thick, curly hair that I blow out every few days. This blow dryer has cut my drying time in half! The air force is STRONG with this one. Put it down on the bathroom counter and watch your hair ties and whatnot go flying. But it gets the job done, and incredibly well. My hair is *less* dry from this dryer, despite the high heat, and looks very healthy and sleek when blown out.<br /><br />WORTH IT!
