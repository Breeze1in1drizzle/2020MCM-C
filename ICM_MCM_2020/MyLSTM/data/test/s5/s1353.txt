I love this dryer because it is so gentle with only two settings. The band on the bonnet is tight at first, but after weekly or biweekly use it gets a bit more comfortable. I cover my ears with Wrapp-it bands when drying. The carrying case is convenient and everything fits perfectly inside even after several uses.
