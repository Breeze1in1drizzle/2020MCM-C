These are so cute! They are good for a boy or girl. Who says you have to be a boy to have a stach lol. These were well packaged and arrived very quickly. My son loves them. The pictures I got from this are awesome. My son is 18 months old and uses it just like his other paci's. Also, if you want to the mustache piece pops off and you still have a regular pacifier.
