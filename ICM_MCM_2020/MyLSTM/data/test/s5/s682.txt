The day I started using this hairdryer, I got compliments on how good my hair looked - no joke!  People asked me if I'd gotten a haircut and I had to tell them no, just a new hairdryer.  It's a powerful machine for how small and compact it is.  It folds up nicely to fit easily in a gym bag, suitcase or small bathroom drawer.  The cord doesn't retract, which is good in my opinion - my last hairdryer almost started a fire when the retracting cord frayed and sparked.  I'll update if anything goes wrong with this dryer, but I've been using for about 2 months now with no problems.  Highly recommend it for the price, value and functionality!
