I'm glad I bought this.  I wasn't going to because of the reviews stating that it smelled rotten or it doesn't smell good.<br /><br />So the first thing I did after receiving this item is to open it and smell it.  It smelled like apple juice.  Open up a canister of apple juice and that's what it smells like... Sweet yet tarty at the same time.  Now I understand why some people might think it smells horrible but I don't have a problem with it. I love apple juice.<br /><br />It wipes the pacifier as its supposed to.  I usually also use it to wipe my Medela breast pump parts after using them.  It's way thinner than the expensive Medela wipes but it wipes the part down good enough.
