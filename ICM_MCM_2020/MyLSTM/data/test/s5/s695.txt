This hair dryer really packs a punch.  I had used this exact model at a hotel in Dallas and then again in Pensacola and I had to buy it.  I've had it for a few months and it does its job and doesn't get too hot.  It blows a LOT of air and dries in a very efficient time.  I have long, thick, wavy hair and it usually takes me about 15 minutes to dry.  With this dryer I'm down to 8 and mid way through I switch to warm.<br /><br />Excellent dryer for this price!
