This hair dryer works fine.  I bought it for a trip to Europe but the hotels and apartment we stayed in actually had very good hair dryers so I didn't need it after all.  But I'm glad I have it for when I go to Europe again and there isn't a hair dryer available.  It's very light and compact and fit into the suitcase nicely.
