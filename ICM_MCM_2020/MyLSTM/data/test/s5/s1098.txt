I hardly ever write reviews of products -- I can't even remember the last one I wrote. However, I'm pretty inspired right now. This dryer has cut my styling time to less than half of what it's always been. It's not frizzy, so I'm not doing tons of follow-up flat-ironing. And, the most important part is that my ridiculously thick hair is completely dry when I'm finished.<br /><br />Now, it remains to be seen how long this hairdryer will hold up, but for now, I'm pretty sure this is the best purchase I've made in years.
