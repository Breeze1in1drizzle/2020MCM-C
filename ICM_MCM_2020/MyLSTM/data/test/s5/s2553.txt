My son was physically attached to his frog wubbanub as a baby so of course as I found out we were pregnant again, and this time with a girl, buying a new wubbanub was high on my list. This is a different brand then the frog we had, I'm not really sure how that works since they're both called wubbanubs but that's how it seems. Still, she loves it. I've had no problems with it sliding and I think the design is so cute! Mine is more pastel and less bright than the elephant picture on here which is exactly how I like it. Our favorite pacifiers by far!
