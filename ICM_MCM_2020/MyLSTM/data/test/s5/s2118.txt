I tried the soothie first since that's the one my baby had at the hospital and I had heard great things about it but my baby didn't like it at all. Then I went to the MAM and he took it the first time! I bought the newborn size at first and whwn he turned 6 weeks I bought the 0-6 months, but I have a big baby, weighed 8 lbs when born. So a smaller newborn would probably need the neqborn size longer. The only thing I didn't like is that there is no handle or anything so its hard to grab sometimes.
