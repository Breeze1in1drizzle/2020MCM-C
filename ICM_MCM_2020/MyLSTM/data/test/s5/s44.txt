I just returned from a trip to Israel and this travel dryer performed beautifully.  All I needed was the plug adapter that I had purchased and when I set the dryer to the international voltage the dryer functioned perfectly.  I had no issue with over heating and had really effective power which was far superior to the dryer in our bathroom provided by the hotel.  I also appreciated the folding feature making it easy to pack.  Highly recommend!!!!
