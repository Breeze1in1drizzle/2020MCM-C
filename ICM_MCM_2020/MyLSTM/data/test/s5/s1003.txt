The first impression from the wife on this one was that it looked 'pretty'. The hair dryer actually is brownish with pink details, contrary to what the pictures on this page may suggest (Black) It has a very 'girlie' elegant look, so the first impression was great.<br /><br />After using it for a while you can clearly tell this is designed for heavy duty, my wife owns a Conair hair dryer and this one is definitely quieter then the Conair one and more potent. It is indeed heavier but at the same time slim, basically it is not a big hair dryer but it is heavier than your average ones, not a big deal but worth mentioning. It has two speed settings you can use and three different temperature settings.<br /><br />Bottom line, a very 'professional' hair dryer, better than the old Conair the wife will no longer use. Additionally an accessory to give volume to the hair is included.
