As a man I take pride in always being ready at a moments notice, but if you have a girlfriend you know that's not always true and sitting around waiting for her to get ready can be a pain when all you want to do is get to the party and have a few beers with your friends, with this bad boy she can dry/do her hair in 20mins or less (not including shower time, make up time and dress up time) Imagine waiting only an hour instead of 3! This has saved me time, money on the electric bill, and my relationship, plus chicks love leopard print, and it works great on my dogs (don't tell my gf)
