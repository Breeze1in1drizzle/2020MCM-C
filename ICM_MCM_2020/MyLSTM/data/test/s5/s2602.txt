I have six of these things. They're wonderful because they're easy for babies to find in the night if they're dropped, ensuring that they don't wake up as often, and because of their size, I have only ever lost one. They started selling them at Babies 'R Us recently, but they don't seem to be made of the same quality, so I only buy the special edition ones- this one is SO soft. We also have the caterpillar (perfect for newborns tiny hands), two dog and a cats. One of the cat ones is from when they first came out in 2011 and one is a more recent one. The newer one is smaller in size and not nearly as soft.
