I've only used this dryer a few times,as it is my travel dryer but I love it.  The ionic feature works even better than my regular ionic dryer in smoothing the hair. The three speeds are wonderful and very hard to find for a travel dryer.  It's a little bigger than most travel dryers but folds up nice and compactly.  Great product at a good price.
