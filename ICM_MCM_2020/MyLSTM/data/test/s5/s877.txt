This hair dryer worked perfectly on my recent trip to Holland, Belgium, France, and England.  There was no converter needed, just an outlet adapter when switched on the 250 V mode and used only on the low setting.  To clarify, you can ONLY use it on the LOW setting, however on the low setting it runs like it is on high - very easy, and worked perfectly.  It is also extremely compact for easy packing, but still worked like a bigger, nice hair dryer.  Hope this helps someone :)
