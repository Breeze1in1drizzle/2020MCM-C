I usually rate a product; however, but some Seller's really hike up a price on Amazon (edit: like this one had it for double). Shop around, Babies R Us, Target & other retail stores sell this exact product for $5.99. CVS even cheaper at times!<br /><br />EDIT: 6/30/12<br />Changing review to reflect actual product. Love the MAM glow in dark pacis. We have 4 for the crib at night. Best to charge them for a couple minutes near a light to shine brightest during the night. IT will dull through night! NOte -they sell for 5.99 typical retail (not to mention sales on buy 1 get 1/2 off at BRU)
