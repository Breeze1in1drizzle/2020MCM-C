This item is great. With our first 2 kids, we were constantly losing their pacifiers. Hanging it to their clothes, with a clip was not an option for us. This allows us to easily find our baby girl's plus without having to tear the house apart. It's also light weight. We also bought the caterpillar one and found that to be a little heavy for her.
