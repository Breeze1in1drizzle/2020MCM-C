I LOVE WubbaNubs. &#34;Giraffee&#34; is one of my daughters favorite ones. WubbaNub's are perfect for babies. Once they can grab, the animal makes it so easy for the baby to find and stick back in their own mouth due to its size. This is nice because when they wake up in the middle of the night they can grab it and reassert it. Helps the baby to soothe themselves and fall right back to sleep. Plus they are absolutely adorable! Now that my daughter is older she loves to babble at her giraffe. They also can chew on different parts of the animal/noonie.<br /><br />I wash my daughters every other day in the washing machine and leave it to air dry! Super easy to clean!
