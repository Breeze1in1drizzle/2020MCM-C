I highly recommend this dryer if you have thick or coarse hair that needs to be smoothed or straightened. If you are the type of person who just flips the hair around and smooths with fingers, this might be too much dryer for you, but I have no experience with that kind of hair. This is my first professional hair dryer, and I couldn't be happier. I have medium coarse hair (mixed race, ringlets, coarse but not kinky. 3b maybe?) that is currently just below chin length. I'm super-skeptical about product claims, so I did a lot of research. I read an article about a comparison of several models that convinced me of the effectiveness of titanium, and I knew I wanted 2000 watts just cause I wanted as much power as possible. There aren't too many dryers with those 2 features, so after reading the positive reviews, I decided on this model. From the first time I used it, I was very pleased. My hair was definitely softer and smoother. I never believed a hairdryer could make your hair softer, but this one definitely did. I can also dry my hair much more quickly, but I think that is because with this hair dryer, I am actually able to dry my hair like the hairdresser does (in big sections, using the curve of my head to smooth it out.) Previously, I always had to dry my hair in 1-2inch sections wrapping around and pulling with a round brush, which takes FOREVER. If I dry my hair that way with this dryer, it still takes about as long, but I don't really get much better results so I don't bother. CONS: 1. I still have to use a flat iron to smooth my ends. For the life of me, I can't get smooth ends with a hair dryer. I was really hoping this dryer would solve that for me, but instead it has convinced me that it is my technique, not the dryer. 2. It really does get HOT. I have to use medium heat around the edges of my hairline, and that can still be a little intense. If you have a sensitive scalp, this might be too much dryer for you. 3. The nozzles seem kinda cheap. My last hair dryer had  nozzles that snapped on, which made it easier to rotate and change the angle. These nozzles just fit snugly over the barrel and often come off when I try to rotate them. I can't speak to some of the other complaints about this dryer like weight and noise. I wouldn't call this dryer light or quiet, but it doesn't seem particularly loud or heavy to me. Personally, I wouldn't want to give up the performance of this dryer for those features.<br /><br />Hope this review helps, and happy styling everyone!
