I have thick hair that is almost to the bottom of my lower back (or top of my bottom, lol). Standard hair dryers max capacity that cost more took at least double the time to get my hair from wet to dry. It's amazing. I love that it has the Ionic  capability and the cool air, to help decrease the frizzie's and keep my hair style set. Not that hair that long has much style.    It did come with attachments that I have no idea what their purpose is, so those are kind of a waste.    I was initially concerned the first few days because the temp. seemed to be fluctuating, however after a few uses it smoothed out. The cord is really long, which is great because the only outlet I have in my bathroom has ruined several blow dryers by melting the plug. So I'm easily able to plug in else where an still reach the bathroom.  I'm thrilled that drying my hair is not a ten to fifteen minute ordeal, closer to five. Every minute counts when your getting ready.
