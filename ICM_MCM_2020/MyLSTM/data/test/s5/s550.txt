I typically don't use hair dryers, but I initially bought this product because I was sick and tired of my hair being wet when I left for work (especially during winter).<br /><br />My wife used this one time and loved it so much, that she has now started to use it herself! One day, she used her old one (I guess to compare power and dry time) and it now seems incredibly weak.  My caution is that this hair dryer will become the standard by which you judge all other dryers!<br /><br />*Important note: For those of you who buy this and don't typically use hair dryers, there is no directions that tell you that the &#34;fan button&#34; has to be turned on, AND THEN the heat button.  The heat button does not start it by itself.
