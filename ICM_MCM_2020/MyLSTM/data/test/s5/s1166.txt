I have long curly hair and I was convinced this wouldn't work. I used to air dry my hair  by sitting in front of huge oscillating fan. Needless to say, only the bottom half of my hair dried in front of the fan, but the roots and everything else was a wet droopy mess. So I wanted to try this - especially now that winter is coming. I really don't want to leave my house with wet hair. It dries my whole head from root to tip, and my hair does not come out frizzy. Its like the heat locks my hair product  [Paul Mitchell's Hair Curling Lotion] in place. I can fit my entire head and all of my hair in the container. I love that it has a lid in the front to open and close, a timer and it even dries my hair on the lower settings. My only con is I need to find somewhere to store it because it's pretty huge. Right now, it's in the dining room. Other than that, it was worth every penny. Would buy it again.
