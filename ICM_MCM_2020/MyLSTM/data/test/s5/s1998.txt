When my grandson's old WubbaNub Monkey got befriended by the neighbor's dogs, it was a sad event. But Amazon to the rescue-and the old was replaced with a new WubbaNub monkey!! These WubbaNubs are so cute and people comment on them all the time during an outing. What a cute way to hold a pacifier. I highly recommend WubbaNubs! They are soothing for babies and very much loved by them.
