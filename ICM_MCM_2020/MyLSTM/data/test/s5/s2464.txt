Different babies like different pacifiers, so if these didn't work for some it doesn't mean they won't work for you. That being said, my baby isn't super picky about his pacifier. He will suck on Avents, Chiccos, and these. Both Orthopedic and Natural shaped. But, these are by far his favorite. I think he prefers the natural shape, but I also love these because they are flexible (no hard plastic which sometimes digs into his cheeks with others) and they are also just one formed piece, which is safer (no risk of the nipple coming off the plastic handle).
