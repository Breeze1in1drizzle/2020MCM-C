My husband is a die hard Red Sox fan. Being from New England we just had to have these on our registry. I had my doubts about them since they weren't one of the big brands, but my baby loves them! He has a very deep palate and need something a bit longer than the average pacifier to trigger his suck reflex, and these worked great!
