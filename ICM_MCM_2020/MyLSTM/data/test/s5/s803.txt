Bought this to replace a higher wattage hair dryer.  We would keep tripping circuit breakers with the old hair dryer (1800W, I think) since it nearly maxed out the 15a circuit.  This lower wattage hair dryer still seems to dry hair just fine and just as fast (I think fan speed has more to do with drying time than high wattage).  The textured plastic surface is easy to grip and the small size makes it easy to pack for trips.  Hightly recommended.
