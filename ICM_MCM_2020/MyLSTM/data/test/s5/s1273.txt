I don't have much insight for the hair dryer's performance as it was a Xmas gift for my wife but her feedback-in-a-nutshell to me was &#34;I Love It!!&#34;.  After exhaustive research on my part to find the best hair dryer at a given price point, I settled on the Onei MK-II based purely on the Amazon reviews and it apparently paid off.  (BTW, she has very fine, blonde hair).
