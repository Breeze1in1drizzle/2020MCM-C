I can't say enough good about this pacifier! I had planned on not using a pacifier with my daughter due to my firstborn's heavy attachment to his. However, she started wanting to nurse 24/7 a couple weeks after she was born, so I finally broke down and bought her a paci. It became clear very quickly that she wanted nothing to do with one. I tried multiple pacifiers and none of them were even remotely accepted by her. I was pretty beside myself about it and did a search to see what the most breast-like pacifier was and was led to this one. I placed my order right away, and as soon as it was delivered I opened it up, boiled it, and presented it to my daughter. She didn't care for it until she got a little upset later on, but then she took it right away! She definitely knows the difference between the pacifier and the breast, but she has accepted the pacifier as an &#34;okay&#34; substitute until boob becomes more convenient. Soooo, I strongly recommend that any breastfeeding mothers try this pacifier if you need a bit of a break!
