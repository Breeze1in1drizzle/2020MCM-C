....well, maybe that's a bit of an extreme statement, but that's how happy I am with these binkys! I looked around for weeks locally trying to find an all-natural, one-piece option. Someone recommended these on a forum, and we've been using them ever since.<br /><br />Some people are put off by their child pulling the binky out with their finger and the loop. It is a minor issue for us. Once she got a little older, the loop works for us - she can easily grab it and pop the binky back into her mouth.<br /><br />This is another standard shower gift I include for new moms. I hate to see a baby using anything else!
