My husband continues to tease me because I continue to gush about how much I love this blow dryer. He says ooooh - it plugs in and blows air - how special (says the man with little hair to blow :) This is a great dryer - I have longish straight hair - and it dries it in a heartbeat without frying my hair - the variety of settings really work well - and the cool shot button is instantaneous. My hair hasn't looked this good in years!
