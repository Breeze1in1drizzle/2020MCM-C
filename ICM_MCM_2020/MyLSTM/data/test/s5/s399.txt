I argued with my lady about buying this hair dryer. I told her there were others, others less expensive, that would do the job. It is after all just  drying hair. After buying and trashing a Conair I finally bought her this Turbo Power dryer. THe complants stopped, the dryer still works and I am her hero. The rewards were worth the investment.
