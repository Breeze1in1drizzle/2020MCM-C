This is a great product.  I didn't really believe all the Ionic hype, but it really does seem to make a difference.  My hair is smoother and softer and dries in much less time (I'd say 30-40% faster).  It is a very hot hair dryer, so be sure to keep it away from your scalp and face.  But, I love it!
