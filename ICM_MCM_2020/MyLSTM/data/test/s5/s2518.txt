My son loves the Soothie Pacifier!  I am so glad I found these yellow pacifiers because there are literally 6 other kids at his daycare that have the green or blue soothie pacifier.  It is so hard for the teachers to keep the pacifiers straight with so many kids having the same one.  This yellow pacifier just solved the problem for me!  I am so happy!  I highly recommend this pacifier.  I have been told that breastfed babies prefer the shape of this pacifier - my son was breastfed and he would not take the other shaped paci's, so that could be true?  I'm not sure - all I know is that this pacifier is the only brand my son will use.
