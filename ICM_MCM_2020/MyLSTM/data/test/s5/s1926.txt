Most parents know that not all babies will use just any pacifier.  My 9 month old has consistently preferred Avent pacifiers since he was a newborn.  We switched to the next biggest size at 8 months, and it took a little while for him to get used to it.  He uses both the smaller and the bigger sizes now.  I love the designs and different colors although I don't believe you can specify colors when you order through Amazon.
