So I was playing some scratch offs the other day and finally won big. 20,000 dollars, changed, my life. I am not so well eduracated and dont have my peeachdee or anything fancy like that. I am just a simple girl who got pregnant while working at the mac donalds. Now when I take my baby places people stop and stare. Every time I go to the walmart and swipe my EBT card the cashiers give my baby and her pacifier attention. I tell you what, nothing compliments 200 dollars in beef jerky like white gold in your babies lips.
