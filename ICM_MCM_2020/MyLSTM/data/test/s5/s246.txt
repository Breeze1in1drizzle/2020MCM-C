I was very pleased with the shipping and packaging. I like the temperature settings, the way it folds and how the cord retracts inside. Mostly pleased with the handle for holding it while drying my hair. Some dryers don't feel like they are correctly made for holding. This one does. I would recomend this hair dryer to everyone. Thanks.
