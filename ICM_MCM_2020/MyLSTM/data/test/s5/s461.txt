This dryer is worth the money!  I've been using cheaper hair dryers for years and finally opened the wallet and invested in a professional quality one.  I don't notice that this dries my hair any faster, but it is shinier, smoother, and seems to have more body.  For someone who has hair that has all the body and styleability of dental floss, this is a huge improvement.  I like this hair dryer and I got a great price for it on Amazon!
