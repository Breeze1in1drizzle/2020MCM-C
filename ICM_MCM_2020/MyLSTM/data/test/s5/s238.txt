I purchased this hair dryer after using on on a trip and it was the hair dryer that was supplied by the hotel.  I love the way it doesn't use a lot of heat.  I also loved the way my hair looked after using this product, the ends of my hair did not look fried.  After seaching the internet, I found that Amazon had, what I determined, to be the most reasonable price.
