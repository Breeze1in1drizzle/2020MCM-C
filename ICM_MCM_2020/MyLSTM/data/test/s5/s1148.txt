Was looking for something exactly like this! I have thick, medium length hair and this is perfect to completely dry damp, towel-dried hair. creates less frizz than a standard hair blow dryer and I believe it is faster to dry your hair with this. I originally bought two different Japanese model hair dryers and returned the lower wattage one to keep this one! Just the right strength. It does get hot so keep a continuous, slow pace as you move this throughout your hair and you'll be just fine. highly recommend!
