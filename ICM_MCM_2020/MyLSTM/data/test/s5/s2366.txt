Be aware there are two different nipple shapes! I ordered the wrong ones the first time. Amazon graciously refunded me. My little switched from another major brand to these with no problem after I heard a disturbing story about a pacifier being swallowed into the airway because it was too small and all one piece. Yikes. These have the handle on the back that make me less nervous.<br />I like that these are not dyed as well! A grest product.
