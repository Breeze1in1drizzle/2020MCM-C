I bought this hairdryer after reading the reviews. I was going to buy a more expensive one but after reading the reviews decided to give this a try. It was worth it! It works better than a more expensive one I had prior to this one. It dries my hair very quickly and gives it a nice full body look. I highly recommend this hair dryer- for the price you can't beat it.
