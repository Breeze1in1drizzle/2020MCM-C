Bought this hair dryer over a year ago and my husband and I have used it<br />everyday since with no problems.  It is easy to fold when we travel and<br />love the fact that the cord retracts.  I decided to go ahead and order a<br />second one to have on hand when this one goes out because with my luck<br />it wouldn't be available then, and I really like it.
