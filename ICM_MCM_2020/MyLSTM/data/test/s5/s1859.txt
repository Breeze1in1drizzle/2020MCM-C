I was hesitant to give my newborn a pacifier at all, but around 4 weeks, she became insistant that she have something to suck on as she fell asleep. I was nursing her to sleep, but it came to point that after I'd try to slip away she'd immediately wake up rooting for something to suck.<br /><br />I bought several [[ASIN:B004IOHN8Q The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Infant Pacifier, Pink/Purple]] (soothies), but she was never happy with them. When I tried to slip the pacifier in place of my breast after she was asleep, she'd immediately stir & fuss.<br /><br />I bought the Natursutten pacifier because I loved that it's all natural, BPA/PVC/Phthalates-free! I was skeptical that my little girl would take any brand, but this one has worked wonders. The pacifier is large enough that it rests against her nose just like my breast. I'm able to slip away after she's done nursing & slip in this pacifier without a problem.<br /><br />I should note that my little girl has had trouble figuring out how to suck a pacifier but this one she took to very quickly. We are both very happy!
