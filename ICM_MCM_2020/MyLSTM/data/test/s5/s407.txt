I love this Vidal Sassoon dryer. Do not be fooled by its size and &#34;full size&#34;. It is super light and dries my long hair in minutes. It has 2 heat settings and a hot and warm mode for drying and setting respectively. It has the option to turn the ions on and off which helps in a good blow dry. It comes with the nozzle attachment for focussed drying and prevention of frizzies. It also comes with the curl enhancer which helps in creating voluminous natural waves.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by how light it is and I manage to dry my hair with only one hand, while combing with the other hand.
