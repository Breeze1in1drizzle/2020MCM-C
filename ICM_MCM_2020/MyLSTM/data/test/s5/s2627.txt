My daughter is 10 months old and she never really liked pacifiers. A friend came over with her son, born a week after my daughter, he was wearing a pacifier. Of course my daughter got curious and grabbed his pacifier and put it in her mouth and loved it ever since. I thought these were age appropriate since she knows how to suck a straw. Love them!!!
