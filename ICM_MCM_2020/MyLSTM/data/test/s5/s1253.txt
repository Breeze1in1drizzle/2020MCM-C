This is my second Portofino 6600.  My daughter and I have thick, long, curly hair.  This dryer cuts down the drying time by more than half.  The first is still going strong after two years of daily heavy use.  Also very pleased  with the diffusser and concentrating attachments.  This dryer has by FAR outperformed other well known brands costing two or more times the price.  I would do commercials for this dryer!
