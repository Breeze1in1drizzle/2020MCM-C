I hate most blow dryers.  They're either not hot enough or too expensive or they feel like they are blowing a soft spring breeze through my hair.  This one is perfect.  I have naturally wavy hair and blow it straight almost every day.  Either I'm loosing my mind or else this blow dryer really does make my hair feel softer.  Dries fast, too. Highly recommend.
