When I bought my first T-3 I paid $220.00 at a hair salon, i was told it was hands down, the best blow dryer. It was awesome, but after 3 years I started having problems. I certainly didn't want to pay 200.00 dollars again but the drug store dryers were not powerful enough for my hair......so my daughter encouraged me to try amazon. I never thought i would find the T-3 on amazon but to my surprise I did find it! I was able to get a brand new, perfect T-3 for 64.95 from discount jungle! I was a little nervous till I got it but it was perfect, it works better than the one I got from the salon!!! I feel like I got the deal of my life!
