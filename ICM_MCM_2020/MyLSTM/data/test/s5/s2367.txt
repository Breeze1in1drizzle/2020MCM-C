After reading the story about a kid who was able to swallow whole and began choking on his pacifier, I was freaked and so glad I chose these pacifiers. Base is large with not fear of choking. The little notch is great for my little guy's nose (his lil flat nose peeks out just above it but I think the round one would suffice too without obstructing any air passages). Not only are they made of natural materials (better for the environment and less likely to have toxins), they are adorable on...think Maggie Simpson ;)<br /><br />You do need to heed the manufacturer's recommendation and replace every few weeks (like you would a toothbrush) cause they kinda flatten out and become tacky. It's actually good practice to replace cause no matter how often you wash and sterilize, over time materials do wear and bacteria have more crevices to hang out longer.
