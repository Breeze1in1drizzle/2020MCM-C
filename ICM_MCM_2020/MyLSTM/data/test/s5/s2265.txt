My daughter has been using the original gumdrop pacifiers since she was a month old and we do also have a few soothies just for back up even though those aren't her favorite... she is now almost 19 months old and just gets the pacifiers for bedtime and naptime and she also teethes on them.... the gumdrops are really wearing and not holding up well (i know we've been using them awhile but we've had 14 of the gumdrops) .... when i ordered these first years gumdrops i didn't realize that i was ordering something different than the original gumdrops... when they came in the mail today i noticed that they seem alot more sturdy and durable than the original gumdrops!... now we just got them today but i think i like them better than the original just because the material seems like it will hold up better and my daughter was very excited to get them in the mail too, she didn't seem to notice a difference! also i accidentally ordered a newborn pack as well as an infant pack but i really don't see a difference.... possibly the original gumdrops would be better for a newborn and baby who is not teething?... but i would definitely recommend these, especially once babies are getting teeth!
