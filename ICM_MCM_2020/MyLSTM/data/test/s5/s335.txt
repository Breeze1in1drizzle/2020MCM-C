This drier has been working great for me for the last few months and I'm pretty sure I am using it harder than most.  I have it out at the barn with my horse and use it it dry him off after a workout and a bath.  This means that while it is only working on short hair, it has a lot of surface area to cover and it holds up the whole time.  Only bad thing I have to say is that the less than ideal environment with lots of dirt has caused me to see a fleck of rust or two on the front grill, but they don't  seem to be spreading and they haven't given me any trouble.
