I have tried several pacifiers and these by far are the best of the lot (at least, they're the only ones my baby want). My son practically grew up to toddlerhood with these. It got him through his circumcision, his regular bouts of croup, his vaccine ordeals and his frightening visits to the pediatrician's clinic. When nothing else works, these rubber lifesavers are the only answer to his explosive tantrums. Without these, I would lose my sanity while treading the torturous path of parenthood.
