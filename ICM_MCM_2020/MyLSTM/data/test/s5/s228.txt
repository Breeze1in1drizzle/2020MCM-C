I researched hair dryers prior to making my purchase because this is something I rely on very seriously and need it to work and do a good job.  I was replacing a very cheap and extremely annoying hair dryer I have had as a back up.  I have not been disappointed.  It has a nice feel, is not annoyingly noisy and does a great job.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a quality dryer.
