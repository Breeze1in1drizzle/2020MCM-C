After spending another vacation week in a Hilton using this wonderful dryer, I knew it would be disappointing to go home and not have one. Its compact, perfect heat settings (2) and so easy to use. The cord is the perfect length. I never take a blowdryer with me when I travel because I just love these wall mounted ones by Sunbeam. You have one button to push to turn it on and then when you're done, just put the dryer back into its holder and it automatically turns off. Its easy to clean, and easy to change the wattage setting. I mounted it near my mirror and the nightlight which I thought would not be a good thing, turns out to be so perfect in the middle of the night. Having two heat settings as far as inside the dryer to save electricity is great for those that want a softer not as hot two-setting dryer or those that are trying to save money among other things. Its perfect, I gave away my other dryer and never looked back.<br /><br />Get it, you'll love it, really I promise.
