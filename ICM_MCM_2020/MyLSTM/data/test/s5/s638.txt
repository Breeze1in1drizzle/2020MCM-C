This is light weight, inexpensive, and was a great improvement from the travel hairdryer that finally broke after 10 years of use.  I could definitely feel the soft and smoothing effects of the tourmaline.  In fact I loved it so much that I bought another one when I was able to find it at Target for $13.  Plus it's soft material does not scrap your walls or furniture when they rub against each other.    Highly recommend it!
