We use the Soothie pacifier and I couldn't find one that was for older babies.  I have a fear of her swallowing her pacifier so I thought this would be a good switch b/c I always have a hard time finding her pacifier in the night.  It's good that it glows in the dark but unfortunately I was not successful in getting my baby to switch.  She cried for the Soothie.  Looking at the nipple it's a lot different than the Soothie's.  Wish it worked out.
