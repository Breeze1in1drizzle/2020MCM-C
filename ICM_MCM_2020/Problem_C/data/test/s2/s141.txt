The pros:<br />It will work for travel. Small enough to fit in your hand<br />It has a switch you can turn with your fingernail or a screwdriver 125 to 250V<br />Cost<br /><br />The cons:<br />It's made of cheap plastic. The folding handle feels like it's going to break when I fold it.<br />It's REALLY noisy. The pitch will hurt your ears!<br />It didn't even remotely blow hot air. Essentially, you're blow drying on a lukewarm/cool setting<br /><br />Follow up: I ended up buying a<br />Conair YOU Reel 2-in-1 Folding Handle Hair Dryer which I LOVE. It worked perfectly in the UK with a 10 amp converter and my hair looked so much better than when it did using this blow dryer.
