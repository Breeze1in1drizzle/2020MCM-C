My son didn't really take to these. I wanted a soft pacifier to give him while he fell asleep and he never liked the soothie pacifier shape. I didn't like the feel of these, they had a &#34;sticky&#34; feel. Any tiny bit of fuzz stuck to these. I thought they'd be a smoother silicone like a soothie.
