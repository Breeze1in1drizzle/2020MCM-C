Binky Bear is VERY cute<br />He is fully stuffed and a pudgy soft ball of bear cuteness that happens to hold a pacifier<br />Binky bear's arms are proportional with what we expect from a teddy bear... that makes binky bear not so great for a binky<br /><br />I find the Bunnies by the Bay product to be infinitely superior because while many complain that they are under stuffed and not &#34;stuffed toy like&#34; enough, their long bendable under stuffed arms enable babies to contort their little under stuffed bodies and arms in ways that allow the pacifier to remain in babies mouth in ANY position<br /><br />Binky Bear's short little suboptimal arms mean that if your baby moves at all the binky is out...and we all know that is not a good situation.
