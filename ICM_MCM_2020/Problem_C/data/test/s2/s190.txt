Great product... Took me anywhere between 30-40 mins to blow dry my clients hair with my old blow drier.... With this new one its cut the time in half... It's has lots of power... Great deal... N it's super cute...   Update: 7-8?months later it only blows cold air. I wouldn't recommend this drier for the price they are selling it now. It's rubbish
