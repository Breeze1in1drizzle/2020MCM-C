AFTER I MADE EXTENSIVE PREPARATIONS TO PAINT THE CAVITY OF THE MICROWAVE I NOTICED THE NOZZLE HAD A CRACK IN IT THAT I COULD NOT SEE UNTIL I HAD APPLIED THE PAINT. THIS LED TO DRIPPING AND STREAKS IN THE PAINTING PROCESS. IT MADE A TERRIBLE MESS AND THE RESULT WAS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS I WOULD OF HOPED . TRIED TO FIND ANOTHER CAN THAT I COULD USE TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED NOZZLE BUT WITH NO RESULTS. MY SUGGESTION IS SPRAY SOMETHING TO TEST HOW WELL THE NOZZLE WORKS BEFORE USING ON ACTUAL APPLIANCE.
