Should have looked at some reviews and believed them. I got NY Mets and the picture has them in, what looks like at plastic case, and an orange stripe on pacifier. The ones I got were blister-packed, and no orange stripe. I really got these because of the otange strioe as I had seen the solid blue ones before but loved this design. So, if you like this pacifuer design, be warned it'll come all blue and blister packed-as this was a gift, they look cheaper than pictured.
