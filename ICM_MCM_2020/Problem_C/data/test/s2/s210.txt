Having had an Amana Radar range for the usual 25 years, I was forced to replace it when it finally failed.  (I had even dropped it on its end, my mother ran it empty, etc., and it just kept going.)  I replaced it with this unit which I used for coffee, leftovers, and maybe popcorn heat ups; nothing like the actual cooking I did with the old unit with its regular and candy temperature probes, etc.  Between 2-3 years old it just crackled and popped and limped along for a day or two with a hard reset.  Dead.  The popcorn setting never worked (other microwaves I have used elsewhere did a great job) nor was the sensing mechanism impressive.  I also didn't like you couldn't use the timer independently when it was running.  Sure, it may be the magnetron but you have to pay to diagnose then replace.  Although it is still top rated on Consumer Reports, read the users' reviews to get the true story.
