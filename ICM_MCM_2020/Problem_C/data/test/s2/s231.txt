Have had numerous problems with this microwave since purchasing 3 years ago.  Makes horrible grinding noises periodically that last for a couple days then they go away for some unknown reason. Light bulb burns out quickly and location is so difficult to reach that I just gave up replacing it.  Convection bake and roast don't do as well as using a plain old convection toaster oven which is a whole lot less expensive. Can't defrost more than one minute without starting over.  It's quite expensive considering none of the special features work very well.
