I initially really liked this dryer.  I liked it enough that I bought two, one from Target and one from Amazon.  It's been a litte under a year and both have serious problems.  One no longer gets very warm, and when held at certain angles it looses power.  The other one is warm, but the speed/force decreased dramatically a few months ago, and now it's sparking inside while I use it.<br /><br />I usually expect 2-4 years out of a hair dryer, and for me to have two of these, for less than one year, speaks very poorly of the line of dryers.
