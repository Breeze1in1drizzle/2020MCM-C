Cheaper price is the only thing I really liked about this. We had it installed in our new house and have been using it for about a year now. At first it was fine, but after a few months I kept hearing this 'whizzing' sound. I found out it was the cover for the lightbulb inside the microwave, it got loose! How does that even happen? Can't fix it myself so we have to call their appliance repair which I'm regretting as that's always a hassle.<br /><br />It heats as a microwave should, I'm just disappointed that it's starting to fall apart already after just 1 year of use.<br /><br />The beeping is annoying, I'm sorry it just is. When you have a sleeping baby and this thing goes off and it wont turn off when you open the door, then yes it is annoying!! We did recently figure out that if you press stop/cancel while it's beeping, it will stop. But really? Seems like a silly thing to be upset about, but it can get on your nerves over time.<br /><br />Hopefully Frigidaire fixes all the problems with it!
