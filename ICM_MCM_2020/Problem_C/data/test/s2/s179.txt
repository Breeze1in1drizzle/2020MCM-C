I think the product is  fine, but I guess I didn't really think it out.  It is stationary, so if the dryer isn't moving, you are moving...your head all around...to hit the hot air.  plus, you can't mount it on the mirror because with the vanity there, its too far away.  you gotta put it on the wall right next to your head and move all around.  I guess I thought I could put on my face while blow drying, but that's not the case at all.
