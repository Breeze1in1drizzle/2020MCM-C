This is the first binky that we gave our son and he's loved them every since. We tried to give him a different brand but he won't have anything to do with it.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, I wouldn't recommend getting these from amazon unless you want pink ones. Apparently &#34;colors may vary&#34; really means PINK.
