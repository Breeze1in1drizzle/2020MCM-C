The quality of hair dryers are all over the map, just like the pricing. I've had cheap ones that have been outstanding, and expensive ones that have been horrible. This unit falls in between. While it is an 1875 watt Ionic, the heating/thermostat seems to be too variable. Even on the hottest setting it stays lukewarm unless you keep it on for longer then 5 minutes. I reminds me of a car warming up, in that it doesn't just start right away, you have to wait to get it right.<br />It is also a little bulkier than I imagined. I do not like the tiny ones, but I was looking for something that had some space considerations regarding storage. It is very large. Combine that with the heating issue and I could not recommend this, even at the price I paid.
