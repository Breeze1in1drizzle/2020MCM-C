The microwave did a good job of heating, but had enough problems that I sent it back after 4 days.<br />1. It blew the circuit breaker, which had held up to other microwaves of similar power for years.<br />2. When starting, it made a worrisome bumping noise.<br />3. The spindle rotating the plate often made a grinding sound.<br /><br />Amazon & UPS get 5 stars for making it easy to return.
