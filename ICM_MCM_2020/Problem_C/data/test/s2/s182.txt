I bought this hooded dryer because I do roller sets & deep conditioning treatments weekly.  At at first, I was really happy with my purchase; the dryer is quiet, and dries my hair quickly.  However, less than 6 months later, the Timer Knob breaks!  I tried super glue, to mend the knob, but that didn't work so this dryer is USELESS now.  I cannot set the time/turn it on, without that knob so I can't use the dryer.  I'm extremely disappointed in the quality item and I basically feel like I threw $100 + in the trash.<br /><br />I can't remember if this dryer came with a warranty, but if I could give the Timer knob replaced I would rate this product higher; for now it's non-functional.
