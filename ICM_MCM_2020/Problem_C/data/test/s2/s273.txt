I had the older version 2083ST and it stopped working so I replaced it with this microwave - has identical size and older model does not exist.<br /><br />Two aspects were problematic from the prior model - one of the mounting screws was located in the wrong position, thankfully the wall bracket and one of the screws aligned perfectly. So had to drill one more screw. However, the two screws are not symmetrical i..e the distance from the sides of the microwave are different. This is bad engineering, as the center of gravity is not the center.<br />Second, the interior is grey, so we cannot be see the food cooking. Moreover, the bottom of the outside panel is tinted (or black) so unless you are 6 ft tall, you cannot see the very dark interior with very small light.<br />Further, the microwave arrived with the mounting bracket (which was located at the top of the microwave carton) bent; thankfully, we had the older one, we did not have to use it.<br />Overall, disappointed with LG design and there is no backward compatibility with older models.
