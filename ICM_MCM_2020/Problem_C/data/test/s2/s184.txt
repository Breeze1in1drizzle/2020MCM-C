Got this for the wife, who uses it once/ twice a week. For a while she was happy with it, but then it started work intermittently with the heat cutting off and then it completely stopped heating up. We had had many blow dryers in the past and they usually last a couple of years, even the cheap ones, so its pretty disappointing for a 'professional' grade product to last less than a year in a light use household environment.
