I bought this dryer after getting sick of having to share my old one with 5 other family members.  It's neither great nor horrible.<br />It does what it is designed to do - dry hair.  That's about where the positives end.  The dryer is very heavy and it takes a good seven minutes or so to dry my baby fine, shoulder length hair.  The buttons on the dryer are in an awkward place and I'm forever accidentally bumping them and switching the settings or accidentally turning it off, mid-dry.  I did not notice any difference in my hair using this dryer with its purported ion technology.  The thing that annoys me the most about this dryer is the cord.  It's nowhere near long enough for my liking.  It's so short that I barely have enough length to dry my hair without sitting down - and I'm 5'3!  Bottom line: If you need just a hairdryer for a short amount of time and don't care that it's heavy/slow/has a short cord - then this is the dryer for you.
