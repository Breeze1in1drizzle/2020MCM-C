I hardly post any reviews but this product forced me to place one. The packaging was not in order. The attachments of the dryer were left opened in the box. It seems to me that the product is used before as there were signs of use. I never expect open box shipments from Amazon but this is an exception. The product is in working condition so I don't want to enter into the hassles of returns. I will keep the product but not satisfied with the Shipping and handling.
