Beware, it doesn't work on HIGH when switched to 240 Volts.  I purchased this hair dryer to travel abroad.  I tested it at home as soon as it arrived at 110 Volts/ US and I loved it.  I was impressed at how powerful the HIGH speed setting was for a travel hair dryer.  Since I was headed to Europe I switched to 240 Volts and put it inside my suitcase. Once I arrived at my hotel I was very disappointed to find out, that once you switch to 240V you cannot flip the power switch to HIGH, you must try to dry your hair on the LOW setting which is no better than the hotel hair dryer. At first I thought it was just bad luck and went to try out my daughter's dryer ( I purchased two of these dryers since I was traveling with four teenage girls).  Their's did the same.  You can verify this at home, just put it on 240V and try to switch it to high with the dryer unplugged, you'll see that the switch won't move.  You can only go from OFF to LOW. If you are happy with the power at the LOW setting and your hotel doesn't provide a hair dryer, them this is better than nothing, otherwise don't even bother taking up space in your suit case to carry this dryer, you are better of just using the one the hotel provides.
