Bought this for my friend's baby shower. It came in a long plastic bag with a cardboard strip on top. Looks like something you would get at a carnival. Also looks smaller in the picture but after thinking about it, you want it to be small for a child to hold. Also, the texture looks more fluffy in the pic than it does in reality and the pacifier looks like it could detach from the lamb. I don't think this would be harmful to a child. Just doesn't look well made. Probably won't buy again.
