UGH... I wished I had NOT purchased this microwave... the ONLY good things about it is the rounded back to fit nicely in the corner of my counter, the 30-second quick-start button, and having the light stay on while cooking... it's the weakest wattage microwave I've ever had... having to relearn how to do simple things that take 1 1/2 times the amount of time to cook... I miss the traditional power level buttons and being able to key in 15 minutes instead of pressing the start button 30 times.... I do NOT recommend this at all.
