I have long curly hair 3b. I bought this dyer thinking it would work wonders on my hair. First, I think it does a great job and dries my hair very fast. However, I would prefer to have the teeth longer and better way to cup the hair so to speak. My hair gets caught in the back and ends up with tge burning hair smell. Secondly, I bought this dyer 6 weeks ago and it's already broken. Amazon is amazing and agreed to refund my money. I think this would work better for women with short curly hair more than anything.
