I have had many other twin turbo dryers. I feel this one was not even close to the same as the drying power, and it is too small , and doesnt fit right in my hand.The heat is no where near as hot as it used to be. The only reason that I didnt return it was because of my own laziness. I will keep it as a second dryer, i will continue to search for something as good as the old twin turbo.
