This holder does hold a blowdryer but only in the downward position shown in the photo. The description says it can be adjusted up & down but that's not accurate. It can only be used down as shown in the photo & I don't know of anyone who just holds a blowdryer straight down to dry their hair. My blow dryer only fits in the holder pointed down. If I rotate it up, the blow dryer is stopped by the wall holding the holder. There's absolutely no chance of using any other angle. I tried sticking it to the tile (like in the photo) on my vanity top for a lateral angle, but not even 1 little suction cup would do anything but slide all over.  I guess holes have to be drilled through the tile to use it like in the photo. That wouldn't solve the rotation limitation problem. DIsapppointed!<br />DID arrive packed well & on time.
