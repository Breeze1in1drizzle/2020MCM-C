You'd expect more than five years out of a product in this price range. However, the control panel died after five years.  Well not quite died.  You can still make things happen, it's just not always what you expect.  You hit the 3 and you get 4.  You hit the Start button and it goes to Help.  On top of that, the fan filters are really flimsy, the tab you use to take them out to clean broke after the fifth time out.  We are going to buy a counter microwave (definitely NOT GE) and a real vent hood.
