Delivery was fast, within a week. The first time using it I noticed that on all 3 settings the air is just warm, doesn't get very hot, which I thought wasn't that big of a deal considering my hair is bleached and I shouldn't be putting a lot of heat on it anyway. The second time I used it the high setting just didn't work, I switched it from medium to high and it just turned off when on the high setting. I had already thrown out the packaging at this point so since it was only like $13 I didn't feel like it was really even worth it to try to return.
