While I love the shape of the microwave (it does fit perfectly in a corner), the turntable is defective and does not turn.  Upon removing the packaging, I immediately turned the microwave on and placed a cup of water in it to see if it was heating ok, walked off a minute and when I returned the water was very hot.  I thought eveyrthing was ok, so I threw the packaging away.  A few days later, I put a plate of food in the microwave to heat it up and that's when I noticed the turntable was not turning!  I opened the door, checked the wheels it revolves on, replaced the glass, gave the glass a little turn and still nothing.  I tried even placing things of different weights on it, sometimes it would turn a little like it was trying to turn but then would abruptly stop.  So buyers beware, I would not purchase this item.
