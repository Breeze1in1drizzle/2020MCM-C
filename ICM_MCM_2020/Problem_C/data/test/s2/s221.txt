This microwave has been decent, until today. The plastic piece that holds that handle on is extremely thin. After a year or two or light/normal use, it breaks. If you read reviews, you will see others complaining about the same issue. The part costs around $16, but I'm not sure how to replace it as the back of the screw is covered by the door. Annoying.
