I did not like this blow dryer and returned it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />HEAVY & clunky<br />air does not get hot, just slightly warm<br />leaves hair looking brittle (not silky & smooth)<br />takes a long time to dry hair<br />&#34;rats&#34; hair as it dries (I've never had a blow dryer do this before- it's weird)<br /><br />Pros:<br />seems to have powerful airflow
