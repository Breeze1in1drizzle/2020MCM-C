I am writing this review to save anyone interested in this dryer to beware!  If you have thick hair you will not find this brush to be adequate.  I have medium long hair and am white, but my hair is very thick.<br />I know this dryer style is usually advertised for African Americans but it works well for caucasians with thick hair as well.  I found a different dryer that is working great.  Conair is the manufacture.<br /><br />Other than the brush this dryer appears to be well constructed.  I did not use it so I can say how well it drys.
