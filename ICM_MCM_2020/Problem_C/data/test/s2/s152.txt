This hairdryer does not get very hot. On high heat it blows warm/cool on the low blow setting. Even on the high heat and high blow setting it is only warm.  It takes longer to dry my hair with this than my 10 year old Panteen hair dryer. No reduction in frizz. I bought this on amazon but I saw this exact hairdryer at dollar general for $15.  It is ok. I wouldn't buy it again.
