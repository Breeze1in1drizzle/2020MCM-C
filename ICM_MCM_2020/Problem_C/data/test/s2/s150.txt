I've used hard hood hair dryers since the 1960s.  This Hot Tools Pro 1061 is so light weight and cheaply made it hardly stays on the table.  The only two settings are HIGH (which almost burns your scalp) and LOW (which takes way too long to dry your hair).  Also it's very difficult to dry the lower back of the hair.  I feel it's disappointing.
