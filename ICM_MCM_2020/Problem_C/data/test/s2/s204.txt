We've had an earlier model range hood style Sharp oven for five years.  We've had to replace the circuit board and it has gone through three door handles.  There is no one in our household who misuses appliances, so the door handle problem---plastic that is not strong enough to withstand the pulling pressure of the door catch--- simply shows the inferior quality of Sharp parts.  I've actually hoped that the oven itself would stop working so I'd have a legitimate reason to replace it; I can't bear the idea of throwing out a functioning appliance.  This is why I give it 2 stars.  But this machine will have cost me $150 in repairs if I replace the broken handle again.
