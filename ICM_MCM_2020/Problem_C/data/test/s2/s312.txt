Out of all the natural pacifiers out there, this is my least favorite. Even when brand new the nipple would stick to the ring and my daughter (7 months) would get frustrated because then she couldn't suck on the pacifier. It also seems stickier in general than the other brands right out of he box. It's fine to use if I'm lying right beside her and can unstick the nipple from the outer ring but is a definite no go for bed time unless I want to get up often (which who in their right mind does?!). We have found much better success with the eco piggy. It seems so much more high quality.
