This pacifier is probably a fine pacifier, but did not work at all for us. Our daughter was used to the 0-3 month Soothie, and we thought we'd try this so she wouldn't look quite as stupid as she did with a giant green thing covering half her face. This natursutten pacifier is certainly more attractive than just about any alternative. However, as the nipple piece is dramatically shorter than the nipple on a Soothie- and, I have to imagine, on most 0-6 month pacifiers--  this one did nothing but make her mad. At 6 weeks, it was already, it seems-- how can one know the mind of a newborn?-- far too small for her to get a grip on. All in all, stylish and trendy, but completely unusable for this family.
