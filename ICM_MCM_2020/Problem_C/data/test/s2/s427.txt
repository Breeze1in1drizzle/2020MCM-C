the top part is thin hard plastic..  husband and I was afraid it'll hurt baby's gum ,.. when your baby reaches 4 months they put anything in their mouth.. they won't know how to put it the right way.. or when you help them put it in .. obviously it won't stay put.. they take it out and they love to examine what it is and the texture of it.. so therefore they put it back in their mouth but sometimes it just does't always end up the right way.. so the hard plastic that we're afraid of, might hurt baby's growing teeth and his gums.. so we didn't really like it.. but the glow in the dark was pretty alright..
