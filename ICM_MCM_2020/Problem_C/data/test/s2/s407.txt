My boyfriend bought this for our four-month old since we wanted one that would stay cleaner and more sanitary.  This one has the plastic cover that folds like a clam shell cover the chewy rubbery part when she's not sucking on it but the problem is that when the plastic part is open it pushes the pacifier too far away from her face and she can't get a good hold on it in her mouth, so it almost always falls out right away.  I love the cute design on the front and the idea of the plastic cover but in the end the design does not work well for my baby.
