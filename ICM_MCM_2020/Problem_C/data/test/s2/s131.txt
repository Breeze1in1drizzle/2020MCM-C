As others have written the night lights are worthless and stop working after about 2 days.  Unfortunetly I bought them because of the lights and thought they would look high end in my barbershop but instead made my shop look bad when I mounted them and one after another the lights started blowing out.  another issue is that I have personaly noticed is that the breaker triggers quite often if I use another item off the other socket.  Definetly, definetly not worth the price tag at all.  You can buy other blowers without the light for way way cheaper so your really paying for the extra light feature which doesnt work anyway.
