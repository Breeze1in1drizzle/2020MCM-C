I order this after reading all the reviews. Before purchasing this blow dryer I had a very cheap bottom of the line dryer from walmart. I will have to say I am disappointed with how long it still takes to dry my hair. I was expecting more since for me this was an upgrade. It feels & looks cheap also.
