but i don't. the biggest thing is that it just doesn't dry. i put it on and then take my sweet time putting on makeup so that this thing has plenty of time to do its thing, but my hair comes out about as wet as if i'd wrapped it in a microfiber towel for a few minutes (which is to say, maybe 10 percent dry--not dripping, but definitely wet and not damp). there are other things i don't like about it, such as the hose doesn't fasten to the cap, just rests in the opening without any kind of clip or click or anything, which means paying attention to how much i move around to be sure the hose doesn't fall out of the cap; or that the hose is so short that the base has to be sitting pretty close to me the whole time. for now, i'll stick with my hard-bonnet dryer on a floor stand. doesn't allow for much mobility, but it's way more effective at actually drying.
