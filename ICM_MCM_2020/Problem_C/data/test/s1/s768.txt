We have the tiger one and we love it.  Elephant is not attached to the pacifier at the correct angle, so you can't lay the elphant down with the pacifier in baby's mouth on the same angle.  Wish I got another tiger or a longer animal.  Won't end up using the elephant unfortunatelly, wasted our money.
