I am really disappointed that I can't return this now. Every time I wanted to use it I had to press the reset button, which was doable. But today, it wouldn't even turn on. I heard a faint buzz sound and smelled a toxic chemical smell as if something was burning though I saw no smoke. Waste of money.
