this had to of been one of my worst purchases.. ever! this was shipped separately from the two other items I had ordered and shipping for this pacifier turned out to be double the purchase price. ridiculous. I also received it two*ish weeks later than my two other purchases. customer service from Baby Haven was the worst and this pacifier certainly is not as sparkly nor are the zebra stripes that black as it is shown in the photo. the stripes are grey and it just looks super faded.
