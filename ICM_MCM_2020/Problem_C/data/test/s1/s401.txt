This review is as much for this product as is for Consumer Reports. Bought all new appliances for a new cabin we built and used Consumer Reports recommendation to buy these appliances. This was one these purchases and was given an excellent review by the Consumer Reports people!!!<br /><br />Lasted just over a year and quit working. GE wants $75 just to look at it before telling me how much in parts and labor they will charge me to repair it. I can buy another company's 2.2 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Countertop Microwave for $89 today brand new with full warranty! Ah...no thanks!<br /><br />My old 29 year old Panasonic is still working great and heats food just as well as this one if not better. I think I'll take my own advice now instead of Consumer Reports and buy another Panasonic!<br /><br />UPDATE: Found out the inverter board is bad...GE wants $250 for a new part + $75 service trip charge and another $75 for repair = $400 total repair cost for a microwave oven just over a year old when one of these brand new is just under $300!!!
