This is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned!! I ordered it shortly before taking a trip to Europe, trusting that it would work, happy about the fact that it was small and compact. I wasn't able to use it at all because it was so HOT I couldn't use it; and secondly it was burning my hair!! It was a waste of money and I highly discourage anyone else who might be interested in this product.
