This unit began to self destruct this morning discharging internal shrapnal and vibrating while releasing a death sound.<br />Despite being treated with the utmost respect it will join the pile of cheap Chinese junk I have accumulated over the years<br />It almost made it to it's second birthday. Pitiful<br />I purchased a Panasonic and a seperate wall bracket as a replacement<br />It is most likely chinese made as well but the design should long outlast generics
