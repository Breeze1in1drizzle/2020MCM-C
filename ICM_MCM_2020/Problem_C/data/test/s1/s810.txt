This product listed is the Soothie 0-3 months, I received the 3+ month version which is much harder and my newborn hates them.  Unfortunately, since the package looks the same I didn't realize it until I already took them out, sterilized them, and let him use it.  I couldn't figure out why he kept spitting it out until I looked closer and realized it is a thicker plastic and says Super Soothie on it.  The picture of the product also shows it as 0-3m.  Very disappointed as these are hard to find locally and are they only style my son will take.  Product description and picture really should be changed to show what is really being shipped.
