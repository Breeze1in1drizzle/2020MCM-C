I was desperately looking for solution to the pacifier always falling out of my 2 month old baby's mouth making him cry hysterically particularly when I'm driving. I read reviews and thought this product would be a lifesaver but I was so disappointed. First, the pacifier that comes with the toy is flimsy, it's not the same quality as the actually one that you buy separately. Also, the way it is sewn on to the mouth of the toy, it pulls the pacifier out of the baby's mouth making it even more difficult for the baby to hang on to it then if it was just a pacifier without the toy. I waited by the door to receive this and unfortunately it was a huge waste. Going back to holding the pacifier in myself.
