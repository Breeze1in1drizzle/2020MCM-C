While using it one day it all of a sudden sounded like it went on low, but it just lost its oomph and it never came back.  The next time I turned it on it ran for a few seconds then stopped working at all.  It had hardly been used, but I had it long enough that I couldn't return it.  Bummer.  I liked the idea of having it hang on the wall.  I hadn't even gotten around to hanging it yet.
