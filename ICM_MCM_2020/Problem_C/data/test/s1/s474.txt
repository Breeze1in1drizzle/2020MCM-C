We bought this microwave in the summer of 2011. It did not heat even when first installed. Whirlpool sent a repairman who fixed it, only after three months of work and making several orders for different parts. Six months later, it stopped heating again. We have asked for a replacement but Whirlpool will only send the repairman again. They will not replace the product even though we have been unable to use it less than half the time we have owned it. This product is a lemon and not supported by the manufacturer. I have read many other reviews that indicate the same thing. We will never buy Whirlpool or any other brand made by this company again! We desire to buy American, but not at the cost of buying inferior products from a company with lousy customer service!
