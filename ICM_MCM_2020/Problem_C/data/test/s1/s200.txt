After about 6 months the dryer smoked and the motor burned out. Now, this may just have been one bad unit out of thousands sold. And the company rapidly replaced it, which is good. Not so good is that they did not send me a return label, so I paid to ship it.<br /><br />Ordinarily, I would rate this a pretty good dryer. It is reasonably quiet, and it is rated at 1600 watts, so it does not participate in the Hair Dryer Arms Race at all stores, where it is impossible to find a lower-wattage dryer that will not blow fuses (surprising more people don't complain about that). I would not want to rate it down for burning out. But six months is not reasonable, and this is an appliance that works in the home in a bathroom, which means it should be beyond any danger.<br /><br />Use your discretion, and keep watch to see if more people report this problem. I suppose a report to the CPSC might be in order, just to get a data set.
