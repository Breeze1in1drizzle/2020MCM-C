I received this set today with two pacifiers. I washed it before give it to my 5 weeks old baby boy. Guess what did I see, there is water stay in the pacifier! Is this mean this is a broken one? Or it's just a low quality pacifier? See pic I attached.I want to return it, but I already opened other bottles! Don't buy it!
