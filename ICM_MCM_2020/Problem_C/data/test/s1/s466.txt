If you are by nature an angry person this is the microwave for you, as trying to use it will do nothing but make you angry.  If you pound on it just the right way, it will work for week or two, then quit. It worked for about a year, then started shorting out.  I had it repaired, but the repair only lasted about two months.  It's only few years old and hasn't been used much but it's already worn out the door latch is loose and won't close.  The warranty is only a year, which is no doubt how Bosche stays in business.  Stay away.
