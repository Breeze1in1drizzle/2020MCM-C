I *hope* I sent in my warranty card!  I am calling the company today to request a refund.  I have not liked this microwave at all, and now it suddenly died.  I definitely want my money back.<br /><br />Edited:<br />I called the company and they told me to call Amazon.  I called Amazon and they issued a full refund.<br /><br />I do not recommend this microwave.  It is so flimsy that I had to hold it still with one hand in order to push buttons with the other.  Otherwise, it would slide across the counter.
