I bought this microwave based on the Consumer Reports product ratings and up until a couple of days ago I would have highly recommended it. Unfortunately that is no longer the case. I awoke to sounds of it beeping every few minutes and an error code of SE. After a lot of research I have seen that this same code has appeared for a fair amount of others. Both the short and the long of it is that it can no longer be used with out spending good money after bad. I know that they don't make things now days to last a lifetime, but I would have hoped for it to last longer than less than 2 years. We are light users and I kept it very clean. I wish that I would have bought an extended warranty. I can only hope that I go the same way this did...quick and without warning and that someone would also say she was good while she lasted.
