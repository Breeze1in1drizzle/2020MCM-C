The plug broke after one month.  Now I have to fiddle with the plug in the outlet to get it to come on, then it keeps turning off.  An electrician checked the electrical circuit, which is OK. It is definitely the plug on the hair dryer.  If I move it around in the outlet, the hair dryer will turn on and off and on...  It was a Christmas present I bought it early December, so now the return policy just ran out (missed it by a few days).<br /><br />Do NOT buy this hair dryer!!!!  Cheap piece of junk.
