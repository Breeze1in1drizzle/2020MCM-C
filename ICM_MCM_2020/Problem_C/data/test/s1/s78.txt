I used this same one in a hotel in Vegas and it was amazing my hair looked just like I had it done at the salon. So excited I bought two one for me one for my sister. Mine was borrowed by a friend never got back ordered another one this one was defective bad!!!  I literally used it the very first time fresh out of the box and I swear there were sparks coming out of the outlet. Unplugged scared thought it was the outlet plugged it in a different outlet sparks again OMG anyway I tossed it in the garbage wasn't worth me packaging and going to post office etc and I was on vacation and had to go buy a new one while on vacay. I loved it but the electrical problem was not good!
