My T3 just stopped working after 3' MONTHs, 3 months !!!  I am a professional and can NOT afford for this to happen while blowdrying a clients hair.  This has NEVER, ever, happen to me with ANY other professional blowdryer !   I am taking One more chance on this product since, I have a bad shoulder &  it really is light weight & leaves the hair very smooth & shinny...   LAST CHANCE T3 !   side note: There are plenty of other blowdryers that also can do a great job !
