Don't believe the &#34;High-velocity airflow&#34; statement - this hair dryer only had a low & medium setting.  I don't have what people would call a thick head of hair and it took a long time for me to dry what I have.  The hair brush was flimsy and the bristles were mangled when I received it.  Another thing I didn't like was that it is quite heavy and the handle is long so it makes it seem even heavier when you are holding it.  I ended up returning it since it was pretty useless to to.
