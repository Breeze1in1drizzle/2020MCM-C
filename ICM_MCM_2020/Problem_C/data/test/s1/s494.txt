We loved this microwave. It had the perfect features, aesthetics and price.<br /><br />Except it quit working. Three (3) separate times. We have had to take off work three (3) times to wait for service technicians only to have the unit fail again.  The issues began within the first five (5) months and have continued.<br /><br />The problem is that the unit will turn on, motor running, turntable turning, light on, but no heat is generated. Food comes out at same temperature it went in. It has been the same issue each time the unit stopped working properly.<br /><br />Most frustratingly, at my last call to Amana, I pointed out that they have spent more in repair costs ($400+) than the original cost of the unit. In the interests of everyone's time, it seemed reasonable to try replacing the unit.  I was told by Jason and Chris (supervisor) that Amana's policy was to repair not replace, so only option was A FOURTH service call to report the problem (per policy). I asked Chris whom I should direct concerns about this policy, and he said Customer Service.<br /><br />Less than helpful. I was fairly certain that I was already speaking with Customer Service. I never was provided with an eMail address, physical address or alternate phone number to express concerns about the policy. Bad business model.<br /><br />We are going to replace this unit with a Samsung, one of Consumer Reports highly rated machines. Yes, it cost a little more, but the Amana has become excessively expensive in time and frustration. Never again.
