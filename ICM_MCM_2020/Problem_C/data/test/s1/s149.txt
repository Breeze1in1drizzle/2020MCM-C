This is THE LAST time I order anything but books thru Amazon.  I have a major probelm every time.  I ordered the Featherweight Dryer with a Diffuser.  Instead I got the Special Edition with NO DIFFUSER for more money!  There was NO CONTACT information on the order -- NO PHONE NUMBer -- I called Amazon and got no help at all.  I had to spend more money to Order the Diffuser.  So I ended up spending more money and did not get the product I ordered through the Amazon site.
