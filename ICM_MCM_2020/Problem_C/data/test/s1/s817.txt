I love MAM pacifiers and have actually bought the girl astronauts twice - once after we lost an originals.  The second set to arrive, however, was not the set pictured.  :(  I'm pretty careful about checking for &#34;colors may vary&#34; or &#34;designs may vary&#34; on Amazon, but this product description doesn't say that anywhere and thought I was safe since I'd bought this exact product here before.  WRONG!  Instead of kickin' girl-affirming astronauts, I got stereotypical pink motifs you find everywhere.  VERY disappointed!
