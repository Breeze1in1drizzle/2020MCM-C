Malfunctioned!  Ordered this blowdryer in March 2015 for occasional use at home (I am a guy with short hair - so I barely use it daily).  It malfunctioned only THREE months later in June 2015.  I was drying my hair one morning and flames shot from the dryer at my head - I did not get burned (nor did my hair) but it was pretty surreal to see the dryer nearly on fire.  Unfortunately, they are no longer available - I have no way to contact the seller and so I am stuck buying another dryer. I have included a picture to show the extent of the glowing fire at the end of this dyer.  Buy this Allure hair dryer at your own risk!  If the seller reads this review - I would appreciate being contacted for replacement.  Thanks!
