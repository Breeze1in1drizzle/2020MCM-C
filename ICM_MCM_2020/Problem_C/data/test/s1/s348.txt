Burned out the first time I used it with 220 voltage!  Worse than wasting my money, I was without a hair dryer/diffuser for my entire 3-week trip.  I was furious because the reason I bought it to begin with was that I NEEDED it to dry and style my curly hair!  It was beyond the 30 day return window, so it was a total waste of $50+!!
