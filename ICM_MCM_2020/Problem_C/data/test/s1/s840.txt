My husband ordered these for our two month old because he loves this brand of pacifier, and we thought these would be an easy transition from breast to bottle. They seem like great bottles. The nipple quality is amazing, it never collapses. My one star is for the supposed anti colic feature. You could loudly hear my son swallowing tons of air while eating, and he would scream for hours after using one of these. He also chokes and splutters during feedings. We have three other bottle brands and he has no issue with any of those.
