Purchased this dryer 2 months ago and it started to make a humming noise about a week ago and within a day is was not working. Seems to me this must have been a refurbished hair dryer because I have my old one that I purchased from QVC 3 years ago and it is still in perfect working condition. Don't waste your money ordering from this vendor. Something is not right that it worked for only a short amount of time but long enough that I am unable to return it. This is one very disatisfied customer. If I could have given it no stars I would have done so.
