We were traveling and used one of these wall mounted hair driers at a hotel. We loved how the product worked so, once home, we purchased one.    Well, the product switch failed in the first 4 months and we contacted the manufacturer. They were nice enough and had us ship it back and sent us a warranty replacement right away. The replacement lasted about the same amount of time, and has the same failure, the switch went bad.     For the low price of the product $23.00 I don't think it's worth sending a second one back for warranty replacement. Shipping two units back is going to cost more than the original product.    Really nice item, I wish that they made it of quality parts I would surely pay 2-3 times the price to get one that will last longer than a couple of months.    Stay away from this item, seems like they have a design flaw in it. Two with the same switch failure in the same amount of time?
