It was very nice when it was working, small, powerful, folds in half, cord retracts, etc. After 8 months, it made loud sounds and burning smell. I dis-assambled the dyer and found a small internal plastic piece broke and got into heating element. My other dryers lasted much longer than this one. I'm not buying this model ever again.
