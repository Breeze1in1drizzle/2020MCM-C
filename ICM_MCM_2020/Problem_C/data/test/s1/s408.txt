I had this installed when I did my first kitchen remodel about 6 years ago. Then all of a sudden in April of 2009, the unit stopped working. Everything else was fine except that it would not heat the food. It would even make all the noise and so on. So, I had to replace it, and decided to just buy a new one and reinstall it. To my horror, less than 2.5 years later, I have the exact same failure. On top of this, if you need any repair service, they charge you a minimum of $100 to just come and diagnose and on top of that charge you for parts and labor! I am so unhappy and furious for this to have happened twice in a row. I will never again buy anything from GE!!! And charging almost 40% of the price of a new unit just for someone showing up at your door is quite silly.
