This item was a great price and I was very happy with it for the first few uses.  It dries my hair in half the time that I was spending with a drugstore brand.  Unfortunately, the tip of the nozzle is melting.  It may be because it's made out of lightweight plastic.  Real bummer as I was so thrilled with its performance.
