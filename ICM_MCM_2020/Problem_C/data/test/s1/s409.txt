In January 2011 I purchased a PEM31SMSS GE spacesaver microwave because it was the only microwave with >400 watts of power I could find that would fit in the space I have.  It looked nice - better than a plain black box.  Approximately 4 months later the keypad stopped working and the microwave was replaced under warranty.  In August of 2011 the replacement microwave wouldn't turn off, and was replaced under warranty.  In March of 2012 after heating a cup of coffee, the third microwave just went dark and wouldn't work any more.  The stainless model was no longer available and was replaced with the black, which arrived yesterday.  Today I unpacked it and plugged it in.  The interior light won't turn off and there is no keyboard response when I press the START button because something in the latch isn't making contact.  I think I've had one of everything that could go wrong.  I would definately not recommend purchasing a GE spacemaker microwave of any style.
