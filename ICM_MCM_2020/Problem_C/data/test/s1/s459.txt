I bought this microwave in October for a kitchen we are having remodeled.  Got it installed about 3 weeks ago and was microwaving some bacon last night and smelled a funny electrical burning smell.  It is apparently fried (which is what I'll be doing with my bacon until this POS is either fixed or replaced.  The top of the unit was extremely hot and it is just totally dead and unresponsive.  Not even a light.<br /><br />I saw all of the bad reviews but there aren't many drawer microwave options and even brands like Wolf and Thermadore are still produced by Sharp.  Very disappointing.  We'll see how the service from Sharp goes...
