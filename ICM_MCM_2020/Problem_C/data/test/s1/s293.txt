After about two weeks of purchasing, air leaks from the handle, the switch, and the back of the dryer. I concerned there will be electricity leakage, who knows when.Today I want to return it, but it says the return is only allowed within 30 days. I was too busy to request the return when I first found the problem. The product is of poor quality and dangerous to use, plus the short time warranty. I will never buy it!!!
