I put a SMH9187ST 1.8 cu. ft. Over-the-Range Microwave (Stainless Steel) in my vacation home.  After four or five months of light duty use, we returned home to find the door standing open and the light on inside.  There is apparently a spring in the door that holds the two latches in the closed position.  That spring either came off its mount or broke, because the latches no longer hold the door closed.  I asked Samsung to tell me how to open up the door so I could replace the spring.  They said no, I'd have to pay them for a service call.  I asked if they would tell me how to remove the door so I could take it to a local repair shop.  No, again.  Keep in mind that the spring apparently failed while the unit was just sitting there, not in use.  The really scary part of this is that if it had failed during use, the door would have opened on its own potentially allowing a major leakage of microwave energy into the kitchen.  ,
