Ordered 2 of the 3500, but received the 3200, which was a lower model, lower priced, by mistake. Somehow, I don't believe that. I feel as if they were trying to see if I would notice the difference. Then when I asked for an exchange, they said they didn't have any more of the 3500s. Sounds fishy to me!
