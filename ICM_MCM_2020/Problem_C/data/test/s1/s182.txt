This dryer is compact and worked fine for the first two months. After that the motor started going really slowly and essentially it can only be used on the High setting now, which barely goes as fast as the Low setting used to. Of course, Amazon only allows refunds for the first month. A waste of money, since I like drying my hair on High. It hasn't completely died yet (6 months later), but I'm not optimistic. Also, I took this to Europe, since it's adaptable to both 125 and 250 volts, and it was extremely difficult to change the setting from one to the other. When I turned it on in England, after changing the voltage indicator, it shorted out our US/UK plug adapter and didn't work at all. So I'm not convinced that it actually does change between voltages.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/18/14: It's dead, Jim. :-(
