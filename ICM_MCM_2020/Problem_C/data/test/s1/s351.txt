Size was good for a travel dryer and worked well for about 6 months until the handle literally started melting from the inside. I noticed that it was slowly getting hot and over a matter of weeks there was a melted hole in the handle. I live in the US so there's no issue of changing voltage, etc. Worst and most dangerous purchase of my life. Pay a little more money and try something else.
