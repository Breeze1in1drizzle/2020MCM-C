I loved this dryer for its small, compact size and remarkably fast drying speeding.. so much so that I bought one after the other, after the other, when my first one burned out. I suspected it was because of the dual-voltage aspect, taking its toll on the little guy while I was in the UK and Europe. However, I started noticing a pattern when I bought MY THIRD Andis 33805 dryer in the USA. With fairly normal use (once a day at the most) and careful care, this dryer still didn't last A FEW MONTHS before it started getting too warm, lost its turbo power, sparked and ultimately fried. I guess you get what you pay for and I'm not ready to shell out for Andis turbo #4, despite my previous love affair.
