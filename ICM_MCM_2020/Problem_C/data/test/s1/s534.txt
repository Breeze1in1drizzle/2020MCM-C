Similar to many other reviewers, we were happy with our purchase until the SE error appeared. The microwave lasted for 3 years without a problem, but suddenly tonight while using the stove, the microwave gave the error message. We tried to troubleshoot the problem, but nothing worked.<br /><br />I called Samsung to report the problem, and they are sending out someone to repair the control panel free of charge. Because of the negative reviews, they do have a special warranty on this part of the unit since it is such a common problem. Despite their helpful customer service, I would not purchase this Samsung microwave unless you eventually want to have to replace a faulty control panel.
