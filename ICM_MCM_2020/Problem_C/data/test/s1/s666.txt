What used to be my salvation nearly became my nightmare today. My son (6 months) put his soothie into his moth sideways. He began to choke. Thank all the stars above, I was there to get it out of his mouth! I will be removing all of his soothies. Especially from his bed! I would urge any parent to use this with caution!
