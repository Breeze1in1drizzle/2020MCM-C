You know this WILL actually dry your hair pretty quickly. CONSIDERING IT RIPS IT OUT WHEN IT GETS STUCK IN THE BACK OF IT! Who designed this thing-Marques De Sade- seriously I wasn't even trying to dry my hair - I was using for shrinkwrapping the windows , when BAM! the damn thing sucks in my hair in a whirlwind of pain. That's when it is actually working , I know that its normal for it to go between hi and low power, but after less than 20 seconds its like&#34; can I take a break now?, Drying and ripping hair out is HARD!&#34; - it sucks- literally - maybe buy it for someone you secretly hate and would like to see bald.
