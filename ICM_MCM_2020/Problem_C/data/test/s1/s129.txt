This hair dryer is defective and dangerous. The hair dryer did not work on the low setting, the fan did not spin. I turned it on for only 30 seconds and it quickly overheated and turned bright orange inside and could potentially have caught on fire. The construction of this hair dryer is very cheap and even if the one I received was just a defect, I don't think it would last very long if it did work at all.
