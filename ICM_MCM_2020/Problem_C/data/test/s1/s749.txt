We bought two so wasted $30  We should have sent them back but just threw away after cutting off the pacifiers. I can't understand why any good reviews unless parents are stitching them up. I wouldn't take a chance on choking hazard as you would have to inspect after each wash and sew open seams? I don't have time for that. I really wanted to like them. I wish I had bought one. I hate throwing money away. One bad thing about buying online. If something goes bad you have to take the time to send back
