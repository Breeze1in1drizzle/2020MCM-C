Worse product I've ever owned, I purchased the older model JVM17501MM on 06/29/2011 and it completely failed on 03/3132013, GE serviceman came to my home on 04/05/2013 and gave me a discounted (50% p&l) repair bill of $240.00. My consumer advocate at GE offered me a replacement of $250.00, funny since this item is selling all over for under $200.00. I will NEVER purchase any product from GE AGAIN. You should stay away. RUN away from this.
