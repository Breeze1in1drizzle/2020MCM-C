I was in a hurry to purchase a microwave after mine had died.  I didn't spend any time researching as I normally do and made an on the spot decision at the store.  That turned in to a huge waste of time.  I bought the microwave, brought it home and installed it only to find that it was a lemon.  The electronics all worked, however, when plugging it in, the fan would kick on while the tray rotated as if the heat sensor was bad.  As a result, the unit did not function.<br /><br />I should have known after reading a few mediocre reviews while I was in the store to stay away.  My desire to get it done outweighed common sense.<br /><br />The Microwave is in the box being returned today and I'll have to do it again and likely drill new holes.  I don't plan on exchanging for the same model.
