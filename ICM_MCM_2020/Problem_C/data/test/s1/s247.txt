The product details never mentioned that the dryer has to be hard-wired to an electrical outlet since it doesn't come with a plug.  As a result I returned the dryer because I wanted a traditional plug-in type, however none of the other product reviews mention anything about this so I decided not to order via Amazon until the product details are more accurate.
