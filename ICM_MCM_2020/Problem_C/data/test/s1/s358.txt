Do not be fooled by all of the fabulous reviews for this dryer.  Mine stopped working completely after less than six months.  I contacted the company and they told me to send it back with a note saying &#34;defective&#34; and my address so they could send a replacement.  I paid $12 shipping to send it to them.  It's been two weeks and I have yet to receive a replacement.  I have contacted the company multiple times since to find out what is going on and I have not received a response.  Terrible hairdryer.  Terrible company.  For all we know, their company representatives could be the ones writing the glowing reviews because I don't know how anyone could actually recommend this product or company.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.
