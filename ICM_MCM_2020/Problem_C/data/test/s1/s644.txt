You do get what you pay for, and even though I only bought this as a gag gift for a pregnant niece, she will not be receiving it. It came in an envelope with no plastic or anything encasing it. just a pacifier in an envelope. Even that I probably could have gotten over, but it has black specks all over it that obviously don't belong. Too gross to give for even a gag.
