I was so excited to get this. My baby is now 3 months old and starting to reach for and hold things so I thought it was going to be perfect. When I took it out of the box I WAS SHOCKED at how tiny it is. The pictures made it seem so big, but then I realized that the pictures were of newborns, not a baby that is actually interested in holding the animal. Not only is the animal tiny but the pacifier is so small too! Waste of money.
