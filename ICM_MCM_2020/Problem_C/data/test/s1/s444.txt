We bought this for our kitchen remodel to fit in the island in July 2012.  I don't like having the micro over the stove because I do a lot of canning and wanted a great range hood.  The heat from canning tends to melt the electronics in micros over the stove after about a few seasons.<br />Once it was in, I was never completely happy because it took a long time to reheat food and didn't seem to reheat evenly.  Not a big deal since we only used it for leftovers....and it looked good tucked away under the counter.<br />When I bought it, I couldn 't find many reviews on it - good or bad, but figured it would be fine-especially with the high price tag.<br />Wrong!<br />It just died with no warning.  Our $199 over the stove micros lasted longer!  I could have melted 4 or 5 of those for the price of this one!<br />I'm going to try to fix it because now I have a custom island built to fit this specific microwave.  Save your money, buy a countertop model and whatever you do,  DO NOT build cabinetry to fit this piece of junk!<br /><br />UPDATE: I was able to have this fixed by a local guy.  Apparently there was some bad circuitry that he was able to replace. Glad I don't have to find a new microwave to fit the space, but I still wouldn't recommend it.  Who knows when it will break again.
