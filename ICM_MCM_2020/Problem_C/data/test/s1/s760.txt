I purchased this set on January 4, 2014 for my Grandaughter who was born on December 24, 2014, over the past two weeks she has developed an extreme amount of gas, and as I usually do when I want to make certain that I am looking at the whole scenario, I checked with Dr. Sears website to see what you should do when an infant has gas, so since the site mentioned the pacifier my daughter decided to look at the pacifiers,  both of the pacifiers have holes in them. I am contacting Amazon's customer service and the company that makes this pacifier.  I think as parents and grand parents we have to diligent and aware.
