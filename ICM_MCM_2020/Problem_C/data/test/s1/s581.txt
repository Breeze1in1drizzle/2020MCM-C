I would never have bought this appliance if I had known the inlet cover (which seems like just a piece of cardboard) is just tacked on the inside of the microwave.  I've never seen that before.  It's not listed in the item description. I guess I didn't read enough of the product reviews.  While I do cover food in the microwave, it seems like it will get dirty and then damaged by things like butter from popcorn that will randomly leak out of the bag during popping.  Reviews for generic replacement inlet covers of this type say that they may catch fire due to food residue that is hard to clean off.
