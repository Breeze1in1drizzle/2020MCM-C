Tried several different pacifiers and our daughter would only take the original one given to her at the hospital.  We got tired of washing the same pacifier over and over again so when we saw First Years made the GumDrop pacifier, we were very excited.  Unfortunately, this is NOT the same pacifier - it is squeakier (more plasticky than the original rubbery one) and less flexible.  In conclusion, just buy the Hawaii Medical Group one because this one is just a waste of money.  I am giving it only 1 star because I feel I was misled by the name which makes me mad.  If First Years insists on making a copy of the original, they need to give it a copy-like name (for example RainDrop or GumBall - I don't know, just a thought).
