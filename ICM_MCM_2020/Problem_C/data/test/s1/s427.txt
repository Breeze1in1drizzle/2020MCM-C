We bought this to replace our GE that died after several services. Turned out to be very cheesy and after the warranty ran out the door handle cracked and then finally broke off. We will be replacing this with a GE which we should've done from the get go. This was a low price microwave but as the old saying goes...you get what you pay for . Some items can't be skimped on.
