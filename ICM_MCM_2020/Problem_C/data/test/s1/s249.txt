I work in a high end salon. I have been doing this for about 10 years. I love the twin turbo brand. I had to send out my 3200 (which i love) for service.  I ordered this one overnight to get me by for a few weeks. I HATE IT. Its not the blowdryer itself but the way the nozzle attaches to it.  It pulls hair like crazy. Everyone in the salon that borrows my dryer hates it too. Im glad my 3200 will be back soon and I will only have to use this as a back up or when I need my assistant to help with an additional blowdryer. Get a 3200 or a 3800 as they do not have this design flaw.
