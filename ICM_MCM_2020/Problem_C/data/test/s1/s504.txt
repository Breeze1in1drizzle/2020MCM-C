We bought this microwave cause it matched the GE Profile Range we had purchased previously.  It looks great!<br />However, after less than 2 months of use, we had to replace the over the range light bulbs; which is apparently a common issue from the reviews on the ge website.  Worked fine for a year after that.  Last week we had an issue where the microwave started beeping to notify us that there was an issue with the keypad.  Turning the power saver off and on cleared the message, and we continued to use it uninterrupted for another week; until yesterday.  After heating lunch, I tried to warm a bottle of milk in this microwave.  After 30 seconds it was still cold, so I tried again.  At that point the microwave filled with smoke and the kitchen started to smell like something was burning.  We were told by the sales guy at the store that it is the magnatron that went (which is covered under warranty, but the labor is not; not to mention the $99 just to have the GE repair guy come to my house.  It sounds like something I wouldn't trust to be repaired.<br />I DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!
