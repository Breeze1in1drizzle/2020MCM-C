&#34;You get what you pay for&#34;. Don't get cheep like me, this hair dryer  is loud! Even though it is identical tech specs to its big sister the Infinity Cord-Keeper , it's the bigger that's better. The larger version acts like a muffler. Spend the extra $20 bucks. I did, the real deal is now on order.
