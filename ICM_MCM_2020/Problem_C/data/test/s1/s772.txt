After my newborn used this paci for about 2 weeks his gum line started to form an indention. I immediately stopped using it and gave him the Avent for 0-3 months, and his gum line returned to normal in about a day. This also happened to a friends baby but they were to the point of taking him to a dentist to see what was wrong with his gum line. They were even recommended by their pediatrician to see a dentist and possibly an orthodontist.
