I'm so disappointed. My daughter is very attached to her red dog so on here I bought 3 more so over time I can replace them. It was NOT the same as the one from the store. The first thing I noticed was that the packaging was different. The Wubbanub in the store comes in a box, this was in a bag. Then I noticed the dog was a much lighter color. Opened one up and have it to my daughter anyway and she wouldn't take it.... I put the binky in my mouth to see if it was different and it was clear why. The binky part feels textured, almost like it has dust all over it (yes it was cleaned first). What a disappointment. Only thing I can think of is that these are knockoffs.
