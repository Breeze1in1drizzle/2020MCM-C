Actually, I really loved this dryer. It made my hair look super sleek and shiny, dried fast and was very convenient to use. Unfortunately, it broke 2 months and one week after I received it. Basically, I'd used it just shy of two months and I don't dry my hair every day, so we're not talking two months of daily use. The heating element stopped working and now it only blows cold air. Of course, in order to get it repaired I now have to ship it to Florida and also pay them $10 to repair it and ship it back. Seriously, just skip this item and save yourself the trouble. Would be fine if it worked, but a product that doesn't make it even two months just isn't worth the time or money.
