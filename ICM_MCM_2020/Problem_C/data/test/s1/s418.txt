We own this microwave in black. Installed in 2010, slow to cook for 3 years, and finally broke in 2013 - magnetron went out. Too costly to repair, so replaced with a Whirlpool unit (fingers crossed). 3 years for an appliance that requires install - WHAT A JOKE! I also had a GE range break in less than 3 years. I own multiple rental houses and used to count on GE. Now I will NEVER buy a GE appliance again!
