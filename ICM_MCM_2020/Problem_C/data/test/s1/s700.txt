What in the world were the manufacturers thinking when they made this product? I ordered one because I needed a paci case that was easily accessible and easy to clean. It would be great except it is impossible to open and close! After struggling with it more than a few times, it's going in the trash. When you are out and about and you need to grab the paci really fast to comfort a fussy baby, you don't have time to fight the case opening and closing it, and you don't want to break all your nails off trying.
