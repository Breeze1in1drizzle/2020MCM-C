I also received the pacifier in the wrong color.  I didn't read over the reviews because my baby was already using this brand of pacifier, so I didn't see the trouble others had written of.  When the description said colors may vary, I was expecting it to have a different design or some other slight variation.  I was not expecting to get pink with hearts on them for my little boy.  Now it always works out that the only pacifiers I can find when I am rushing out of the house are the pink ones.
