I bought these pacifiers because they're so popular and everyone raves about them. As soon as I opened the package, I noticed a smell. I looked at the package (which was already open, so too late to return) and it said they were vanilla scented to appeal to babies. Yuck! They smell awful. Plus who knows what chemicals were used to make plastic smell like fake vanilla. I will not give these to my baby.
