I bought this hair dryer in May and ever since I got it, when I turn it on it runs for a while and then it just shuts off , I have to wait between 10 and 15 minutes for it to come back on.  I would really like an exchange and I have not figured out how to contct you.  This hair dryer is still under warranty.  Please advise me what I am supposed to do as this was a pretty expensive hair dryer and it has been cutting out since I got it.  I could not find a way to reach you.  Hoping someone will contact me soon.  Thank you
