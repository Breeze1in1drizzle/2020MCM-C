This model performed as to be expected... it adequately heated items. After just over one year it suddenly suffered a short and started starting by itself. Additionally, the control pad stopped working. We temporarily overcame the problem by leaving the unit unplugged until needed and it then only sometimes functioned. Perhaps the old adage is correct in you get what you pay for.
