I had only ever used cheap hairdryers in my life and decided to finally get a good one. I already owned one of their straighteners, so I decided to give their dryer a shot too. They're decently priced and are also a very high quality product. I have super thick hair that normally takes ages to dry all the way. This dryer cuts the time by a significant amount. There is also a free manufacturer warranty on the item, so definitely take advantage of that if you're nervous about trying a brand you don't know.
