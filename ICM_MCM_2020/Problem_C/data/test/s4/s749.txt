If your baby takes a soothie/paci then this is the perfect paci and lovey in one!  Baby can hold it easily and play with it in addition to be soothed by it.  It is also VERY cute and durable. Only issue is cleaning.  I wash in a mesh bag to clean the giraffe portion and then boil hot water to sterilize the paci..just a little cumbersome.
