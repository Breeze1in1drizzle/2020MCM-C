We needed this size and the Danby works.  The controls are a little quirky, you have to put a &#34;0&#34; in front of the timer to set minutes but not all the time...  took some getting used to.  The only real design flaw is that, unlike most microwaves where you push a button and the door pops open, you have to pull the handle on this one.  And the machine is so small and light that you need two hand to open the door or the whole thing moves around and doesn't open.  This can be a pain.  But if you need this size, the cooking is fine.
