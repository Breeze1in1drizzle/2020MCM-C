Our twins love these pacifiers.  The handle is the part that glows in the dark (not the whole pacifier).   This feature makes it easy to find the pacifier if it falls out  within the first hour of putting the babies to bed.   My only complaint about the pacifiers is that there's a nose cutout only on the top, but the babies are old enough to put the pacifiers in and take them out on their own, and the babies don't know there's a right way....   so the pacifiers end up upside-down about half the time and slightly poking them in the nose.    Other than that- the pacifiers are great.  We boil them on occasion to sterilize.
