I had this hair dryer for a couple of years and the plug went bad, so I tried replacing it with several different brands.  I ended up returning every one I bought and then decided to look at Amazon to see if it was even possible to buy the same model again.  I was thrilled to find it and immediately bought it.  For whatever reason the air does not get as hot as the original and the low setting is a little bit strong for a low setting.  Compared to the numerous brands I just tried this was still my favorite and am happy to have it!
