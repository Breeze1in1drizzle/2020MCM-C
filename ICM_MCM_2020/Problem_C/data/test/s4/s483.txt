We used the Dacor labelled version of this aplliance for 10 years before it gave out. Found out this is the exact same appliance as the Dacor, at half the price. So we ordered this one, but returned it immediately because it  had dents, so obviously had been dropped, and seemed to be making a louder noise than the old Dacor when operating and I was afraid it had internal damage. Amazon was as always good on making full refund on its return. I then came across a highly discounted floor model microwave that featured a 400 cfu exhaust system (vs the 300 cfu exhaust on this product), a feature very important to my wife who does a lot of stir frying. The microwave I bought is also 1100 watts vs 850 watts on this one, but I don't know how important an extra 250 watts really is. 850 watts was just fine for us for  10 years.  Could it be the lower wattage helped it last so long? And the convection oven utility is something we may miss more than we now think we will.<br />Anyway I think this is a pretty good product, particularly if you use the convection function a lot. One word of advice if you buy this and vent it to the outside, remove the vent flap on top of the unit and install a vent flap at the end of the duct line. Our vent flap became loaded with grease and stuck in the closed postion. The exhaust  then entered and covered the wiring and internal parts with grease, causing it to overheat and blow the magnitron. Also be religious about keeping the vent screens clean. If we had done those things our old Dacor may have lasted who knows how much longer. We considered repairing it but the technician said there was too much grease.
