When I first pulled it out of the box I was surprised to find that mine at least had a sparkly finish but I decided to try it before passing any judgments on how the product works. I'm happy I did. The dryer has 6 settings each tailored to a different hair type, which is great. In addition to that handy perk, it also has instant cool for setting styles. My hair is always very soft and pretty after using the dryer. Glad to say that I love it!
