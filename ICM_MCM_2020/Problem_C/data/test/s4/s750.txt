(I am updating my initial review that said we could live without this product...we CANNOT live without!)    PROS:  -Cute  -Easy to find the pacifier with such a big thing attached to it  -Good pattern for the baby to look at  -Will hold it propped in her mouth if she's REALLY REALLY tired  -Easy to grab, so at night she can find it in her crib and pop it back in her mouth!      CONS:   --> Only reason I'm giving this 4 stars: Paci doesn't detach so the animal AND the pacifier have to go into the washer  -Easy for baby to grab and she pulls it out of her mouth ALL THE TIME    I would buy this again and am tempted to buy a second one just in case we lose this one!!
