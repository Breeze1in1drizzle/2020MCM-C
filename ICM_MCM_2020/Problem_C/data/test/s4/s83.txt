This is a very good hair dryer, especially if you are less accustomed to professional dryers. If you like myself have been buying Conair or Revlon dryers since you were a teenager then you'll appreciate a step up from those. This dries my hair quickly without an intense level of heat. Better yet much less noise and a longer cord than my previous dryers. A solid purchase.
