I graduated my twins from the soothies to these a few weeks ago, and they have a much easier time latching onto these great pacifiers!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-They come with a case that covers the nipple<br />-Easy to use by my twins<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Nipple is hollow. During the cleaning process I have on a couple occasions gotten soapy water stuck in the nipple & have had to clean them again; making sure to rinse out the inside of the nipple by sucking water in and out.
