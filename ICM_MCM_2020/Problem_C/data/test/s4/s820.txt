My 5 month old daughter likes to play with this.  I'd definitely buy it again, and will perhaps for a gift.  One suggestion:  it seems the pullies are just a tad short or tight.  For a young baby they aren't strong enough to hold the paci in their mouths, so it gets pulled out while driving, etc.<br /><br />But all in all, this is a great baby product.  She really uses the pullies and it does indeed exercise hand-eye, and cause-effect reactions.
