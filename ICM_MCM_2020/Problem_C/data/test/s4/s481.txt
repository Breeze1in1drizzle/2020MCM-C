Direct replacement in my RV for the original that lasted over 15 years.  I hope I get that same life out of this one.  All of the previous reviews were spot on, in the fact that the new one is very hard to get the two mounting bolts to start (took about 40 minutes) and the new models fan and motor are far louder than the old one was.  But the unit works great in all categories.
