I love this duck! My daughter is only 2 months old, she does not take a pacifier often, but when she does she has trouble keeping it in her mouth. This duck keeps the pacifier in/near her mouth so she can play with it or suck if she wants. It has been great for when she is cranky in the car.<br /><br />A friend of mine recommended the Wubbanubs to me. She said her daughter used to grab on to it and chew the pacifier. Whatever keeps them occupied is ok with me.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I think it could be a little cheaper. All it is is a tiny stuffed animal (smaller than a Beanie Baby) sewn onto a Soothie pacifier. Makes me wish I had thought of it first...
