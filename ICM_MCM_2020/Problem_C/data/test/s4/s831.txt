I wish wubbanubs weren't so pricy. Avent soothies on Amazon are under $2 a piece, ans the stuffed animal can't possibly cost much, but they charge nearly $15 to sew them together. That being said, my baby loves her soothies, this is easy to find if it falls or is dark, and it's cute. It seems to keep the paci in her mouth a little better. It minorly interferes with breastfeeding; if my baby suckles on this a long time, she'll chew on my nipple a couple times before latching like normal, so wait to introduce this until the baby is a pro at latching. Overall, I am happy to have this, but if something happens to mine, I may just sew my own.
