Both of my daughters have used Wubbanubs.  We stumbled upon the first one by accident and have been hooked ever since.  These have a Soothie pacifier with an attached animal.  The animal helps newborns keep the pacifier in their mouths.  As the baby grows the animal makes the pacifier easy for them find in the dark and it doubles as a 'lovey.'      The only draw back is the animal is permanently attached.  I have found the easiest way to clean it is to put it in the washing machine.  Do not put it in the dryer (this breaks down the pacifier).  I recommend having several wubbanubs so one can be washed while the baby uses the others.  You should regularly check the pacifier for tears and discard when it gets old and worn.    I recommend having several Wubbanubs.  I keep 1 at day care, 1 in the car, 1 in the diaper bag for back up, and 1 or more in the crib.  This way I don't have to go searching when the baby is crying.  I also keep several on hand to give as baby shower gifts.
