We do not have this exact model. We have a SMH 9187st. Ours is three years old and just recently got the dreaded 5E/SE error. I found online that if you called them they would cover it under an Epidemic Warranty for the specific problem of the 5E keypad error. . Called they sent a local repair man out in less than 7 days all fixed at NO CHARGE.  I feel like Samsung is well aware of this issue and with and will stand behind their products . I would buy another one after this experience.
