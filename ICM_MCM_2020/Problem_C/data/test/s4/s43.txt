This is a cute hair dryer and my 2-year old daughter loves it because it's pink and has a kitty on it.  Would be nice if it had a cooler setting on it.  My daughter cries sometimes because it's too hot.  All in all, a good buy because the gimmick of a pink hair dryer got her to dry her hair with it when she wouldn't let me dry it with my hair dryer.
