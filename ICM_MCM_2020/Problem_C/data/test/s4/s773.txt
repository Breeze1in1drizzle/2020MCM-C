In theory, these pacifiers are larger than the newborn-size ones. However, I can barely tell the difference. If I look very closely, these look slightly larger than the newborn ones (like 1 or 2 millimeters longer and 1 millimeter thicker). Because the difference in size is so small, I probably could have continued to use my newborn-size ones for my four-month old baby.<br /><br />That being said, I like the gumdrop style of pacifiers very much. They are the only kind that my son likes (he does not like orthotic-style pacifiers). I've read other reviews that say the gumdrop pacifiers sold by Amazon are not the exact same ones as hospitals use. While this may be true, my son and I can't tell the difference.
