It is great for a travel blow dryer.  Powerful enough to get the job done, but because it does not put out as wide of a path of hot air as my big hair dryer it does not do the job quite as quickly and evenly as it.  The color is a metallic purpley pink.  I did receive the zebra bag and attachments with it too.  If traveling internationally be sure to read and follow the instructions or you could fry it.
