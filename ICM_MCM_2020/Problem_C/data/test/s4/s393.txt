Overall I found this dryer to be well built, powerful unit though a bit on the heavy side.  Being a bit of a procrastinator when it comes tto getting haircuts, my hair tends to get fairly long between cuts and this dryer worked quickly and did a good job.<br /><br />Since it's very similar to the unit my wife uses (and I use now and then) I'm sure it would be fine for her use as well.<br /><br />Not sure what the point of the ion setting is all about (doesn't seem to make any difference when I used it), but it's there.<br /><br />If I needed a new dryer, this would fill the bill.
