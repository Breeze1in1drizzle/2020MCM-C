I've tried a few different brands of pacifiers and these were hands down the best. I tried the NUK type and they kept flying out of my baby's mouth. She has done well with these since birth (she is now 9 months). She had some of the clear pacifiers and they were so hard to find if they fell or got misplaced. Try the colored ones. I highly recommend them!
