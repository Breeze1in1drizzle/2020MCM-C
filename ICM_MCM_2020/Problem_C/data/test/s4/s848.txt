I got this as a shower gift from an friend and experienced mom of two. She said that it was the only paci that her two boys would take when they were newborns...that other paci's were too big/long and caused them to gag or wouldn't stay in their mouth.<br /><br />Boy was she right!!! I tried one of those green soothie paci's on my daughter and they popped right out of her mouth...she couldn't grip them at all. Then we tried playtex most like mother paci...way too long, hard to keep in the mouth and my daughter did't like the odd shape. First time moms- be ready try out several different paci's/teethers on your baby, every baby is different and will prefer different things. ;-)<br /><br />Mam works well, here are some pro's...<br /><br />-Baby loves it<br />-they are small and don't gag baby<br />-cute<br />-offer a variety of designs (even offer gender neutral)<br />-they come with a nice paci storage box.<br />-The shape is easy for my daughter to grip and put back in her mouth on her own (since around 4/5 months).<br /><br />We're already onto the next size now that she's 8 months and all is well.<br /><br />A five star product from baby's perspective, one star deduction (from Mom's perspective) for the following reasons...<br /><br />A few minor cons...<br /><br />#1 it doesn't have a blowhole in the front (like the playtex one) to squirt out water that accumulates from washing...which makes me worry about germs/hygiene<br /><br />#2 it is made from three pieces (nipple, face shield, and knob) which is a safety concern (it is recommended to buy only 1 piece constructed paci's (like the soothie) in case parts fail and come apart it could be a choking hazard<br /><br />#3 Not sure about quality of the painted on designs and plastic of the knob on the front...they scratch right off and look used after a few days of normal use...also once she started teething she would chew on the opposite side of the paci and could scratch that softer plastic too much with her teeth (it's too soft). Packaging states that it's all BPA-free.<br /><br />#4 Face shield was a bit too high on the top and used to hit the corners of her nose a little when she sucked...nothing too bothersome though.
