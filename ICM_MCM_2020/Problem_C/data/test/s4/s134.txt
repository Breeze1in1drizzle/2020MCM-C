The hairdryer is not overly powerful but I have long, thin hair so it does the trick. I wish the cord was a little longer but I'm sure it will relax over time. I agree with other reviewers that the night light is a little too bright. I just unplug it at night and since I installed it directly over the outlet this has not been a big problem. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase and it keeps it off the counter. I particularly like the little attachment to hang the cord.
