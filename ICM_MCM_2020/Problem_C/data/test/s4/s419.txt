It was not the powerful motor ones at the Salon she was expecting. However it more than meets her needs at home which was why I bought it for her in the first place. A decent price for a nice looking blow dryer. There are three speeds, three temperatures and a cold button. It comes with two detachable mouthpieces and a sample oil product you can rub in your hair before you stylize it.<br /><br />I'm not sure how it stands up to the Remington for the same price. That one looks more powerful from the description.
