Curly girls, you're hair will love this. Gives my curls volume without frizz. My hair dries quicker this this dryer, but it is not super hot. The shape of it allows you to shape your air while you dry it. If you have curly hair, get this now! I do wish it had some sort of attachment that was similar to a concentrator so I could blow dry parts of my hair out. You can take off the diffuser attachment but it's not hot enough or concentrated enough to make my hair do what I want for that type of style. I have to use a traditional dryer if I am doing something other than just being curly.
