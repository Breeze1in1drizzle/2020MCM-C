I purchased this product because I hated running in my son's room each time his pacifier kept falling out of his mouth... I just received this product today and I love it...it's super cute and it does what it's made for.  As soon as my lil man (2m old) went down for a nap, I decided to try it out.  It does stay where its suppose to, but I think My lil' man still needs to get use to the pacifier, for he turns his head to the side alot and the pacifier doesn't want to stay in his mouth. I just think he has to get use to the fact, that the pacifier isn't going anywhere and that he can still get it in his mouth (that's why I gave it 4 stars).  I love that while its on his chest, he can grab onto the dog...it's seems to comfort him a little.  I would highly recommend this product to any parent.
