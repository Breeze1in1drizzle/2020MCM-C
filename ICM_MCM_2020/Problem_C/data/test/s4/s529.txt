Our microwave was working fine, but had a number of rusty spots.  I cleaned the inside really well and sanded the spots to bare metal.  There was enough paint in the can to cover the spots as well as put a light layer on the remainder of the interior.  i.e. to give a uniform color appearance.  The only issue is that it took a week for it to air out.  You could still smell it a couple of weeks later.  But eventually it went away.  Overall, I'm happy.  The 10-yr microwave continues to work well and now it looks nice again too.
