Best hair dryer I have ever owned.Love the cool setting.It makes my fine straight hair shiny and silky but still gives it volumn.I dry it part way on the medium setting and finish with the cool.It takes a little longer to dry but my hair looks amazing.Four stars only because for me the extra long cord is way longer than I need.I can see where it would be useful to a lot of people though.Nice weight for anyone that has issues with arthritis or tendonitis like I do.Throw out your drug store hair dryers and make the investment.You wont be sorry.
