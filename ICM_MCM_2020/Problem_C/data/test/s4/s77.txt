This dryer has good power & my hair comes out good (thin straight hair). It's a bit heavy so it wouldn't be good for someone with gripping or strength concerns. The on/off and heat buttons are not placed well. I accidentally turn the dryer off several times while I'm drying my hair, but that is only a minor inconvenience.
