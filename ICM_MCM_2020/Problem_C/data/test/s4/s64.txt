I have very curly hair & am used to blow drying it straight (have been doing it for >10 years) and using a flat iron to get it frizz free.  This hairdryer is not as good as most of the reviews made it seem: the nozzle only covers a small area, and I still need to use a flat iron.      However, the hairdryer is powerful--it cut 5 minutes off my hair drying time (20 min down to 15).  Another plus is that it is quieter than most.
