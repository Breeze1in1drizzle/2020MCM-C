At first I was with everyone else on the thing not staying in place and repeatedly falling out. I figured out that it has to be locked. If you twist it hard enough, it locks in place. I can now move freely and don't have to keep still thinking the hose will fall out, cause it won't....So this is a great product. Used it to deep condition my hair and I have no complaints. The brush attachment serves no purpose though, but it did feel good on my scalp when used as a regular brush.
