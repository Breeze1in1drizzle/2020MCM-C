I've had this microwave for a year and am pleased and have no problem until a few days ago. That was when I was cleaning the bottom of the drawer from food that was stuck on. I made the mistake of putting too much water in the drawer using a wet sponge. I turns out that the bottom of the drawer is NOT really sealed for thin liquids (I doubt if food would get thru the bottom of the drawer). Anyway shortly after I cleaned it the drawer wouldn't go in or  out. It turned out that water had leaked thru the bottom of the drawer and found it's way to the motor that controls the door - the motor was burned out and had to be replaced under warranty. It took the repairman a month to get the parts (bad) .It was my fault but it could have been designed better to seal the drawer totally. So do not let a lot of liquid get on the bottom of the drawer as I did.. I also strongly recommend getting an extended warranty - things like this with a mechanical component will fail well before the electronics fails .Also it's ridiculous that it took the repair man a month to get the parts.
