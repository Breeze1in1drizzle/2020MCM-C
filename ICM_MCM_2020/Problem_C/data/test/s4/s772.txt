LOVE THESE!<br /><br />A lot of people say they're baby won't take them if they introduce them later, which I can understand because the nipple is a lot different than a traditional pacifier.  I did my research on them before my baby was born and decided on the gumdrop, because they don't block the baby's face and the nipple is more contoured to a smaller baby's mouth.  I took them to the hospital with me and my daughter's been loving them since the day she was born!  I do think they are pretty ugly (I like the other types with t he cute designs), but I believe these are safer and healthier.  My only concern is that she doesn't like other pacifiers and I believe these only go up to 6 months, I haven't seen a larger size anywhere.  Guess that's when we will try to take her off the bink?<br />All in all, very pleased with these.<br /><br />PS- Don't use in the microwave sterilizer, it changes the pink and purple to an ugly brown color, not sure why.  Stick with hot soap and water to clean.
