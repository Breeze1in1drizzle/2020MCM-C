My friend told me about this product when I was complaining about jumping up every 30 seconds to stick the paci back in my daughter's mouth.  (She would scream bloody murder every time it would fall out when she was going to sleep).  This has been a life saver!  This product would be better if the stuffed animal could detach from the paci though.  I have to hold the stuffed animal with tongs so I can boil the paci to sanitize it.  Also, I have to move the wubbanub away from my daughter once she falls asleep because a couple times the stuffed animal part ended up on her face.  It's a great product, but you have to be careful about it in that respect.
