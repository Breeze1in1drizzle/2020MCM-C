My first son liked this brand of pacifier a lot so I bought these for my second son after he rejected the ones the hospital gave us. He still isn't a fan, but occasionally he'll suck on one if we encourage it enough. I think it's tough with pacifiers because it's baby's preference, but these seem to be breastfeeding friendly from what I've read and we haven't had any issues with them lasting long term.
