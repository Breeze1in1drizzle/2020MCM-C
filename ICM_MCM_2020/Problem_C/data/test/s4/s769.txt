I love these pacifiers, unfortunately, my son doesn't.<br />I love that these are all one piece of plastic. If you've tried different types of pacifiers then you know that some pacifiers get water, soap and dirt down in them that make them impossible to keep around for very long.<br />Since this pacifier is one piece of plastic all of these issues are resolved.<br />I ordered several different types of pacifiers to see which once my son would take to. While I would have picked this one... he didn't. :/
