This hair dryer is quiet and does a good job. We bought it because we liked the ones at motels and timeshares we had seen and wanted one like them. The night light is quite bright(almost too bright for us). The air flow is quiet and does a good job but does not offer separate heat/ air controls. Overall we are pleased with it.
