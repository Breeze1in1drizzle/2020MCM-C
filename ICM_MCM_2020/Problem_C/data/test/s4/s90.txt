I have very thick, very curly hair that is below my shoulders and this dryer works great.  I diffuse my hair and my only complaint is that the nozzle on the dryer is a little big and is a tight fit for the largest connector to my Helen of Troy diffuser.  It is a little heavy, but I don't hold the dryer above my head when I dry my hair...if I did, they weight of the dryer would probably be a little bothersome.  The hot setting on the dryer gets really hot - which I like, and the cool shot button gets the dryer as cool as possible reasonably fast.      After trying and returning other dryers, I'm happy with this one.  It's not too expensive and it works great for me.  I've only had it about a week, and some other reviews said it stopped working after a few months, so we'll see.
