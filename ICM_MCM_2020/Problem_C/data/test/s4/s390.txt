Like all the twin turbo dryers, this one is built to last. The dryer feels solid and the materials are high quality, it's also much lighter than my 3200 (and smaller). I'm an editorial stylist and I'm hard on my tools but my twin turbos always last for years (and they're repairable). A few things to mention, the nozzles on my dryer are very hard to get on and hard to rotate when in place (perhaps they just need to break in?) Also this dryer has a shorter &#34;snout&#34; much like the 3500, so if you're used to having a more traditional dryer like the 2700 or 3200 it will take a bit of getting used to. Very nice dryer with great hot air output, the best as far as i'm concerned.
