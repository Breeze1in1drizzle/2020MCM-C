Great hair dryer with plenty of power, however not recommended if the selling feature for you is the retractable cord as this aspect of the product did not last long...(maybe a dozen times if that).  Otherwise, recommended, great price for a great product (I've had it nearly 3 months at this point and will update if it breaks within a year).
