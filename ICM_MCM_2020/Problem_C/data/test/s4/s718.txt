I originally got the brown bear wubbanub for my daughter. I loved it so much and ordered a second one for her. It does its job: have her paci stay in place in a cute way. But I take one star off because the long horn is less soft than the brown bear. It feels a bit rough and that was a bit disappointing to me.
