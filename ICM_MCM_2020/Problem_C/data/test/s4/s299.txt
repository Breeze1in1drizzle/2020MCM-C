I needed to replace my conair wall mount hair dryer since the tab that helps hold the dryer on the wall broke off.  So fortunately I found this beauty which matches nicely with my black and oil-rubbed bronze fixtures in my bathroom.  I like the LED light also as it makes the bathroom feel very modern.
