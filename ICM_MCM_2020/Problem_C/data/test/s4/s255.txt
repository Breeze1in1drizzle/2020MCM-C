[[ASIN:B0017WNHYG Turbo Power Twin Turbo 2600 Hair Dryer]] I bought this for my mom's beauty salon; she had some of these but they were worn out, so basically she knew what to expect from this product.  Although it was a good buy, it wasn't exactly a bargain as the price was not very far from what I could get on a 'brick and mortar' store. As of know it has been what expected: reliable, and comfortable in hand. I (my mom) would recommend this product.
