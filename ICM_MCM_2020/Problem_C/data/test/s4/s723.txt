This dual pack was perfect for our needs. We use the bigger bag for used diapers when we're on the go, and my wife uses the smaller bag for reusable pads. The other reviews are right that the smaller bag is pretty small, you can't use it for diapers.<br /><br />The diaper bag did smell a little after holding a diaper for a couple hours, but we just throw the bag in the wash and it comes out just fine.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because it would have been nice if these had zippers, not drawstring. However, the drawstring does a good job so it's definitely not a deal breaker.
