It makes me laugh that this product is touted specifically for men.  It's colors might be manly (red, blue, and black), but the hair dryer works equally well for a man or a woman.  My wife used it extensively.<br /><br />The dryer itself is very functional and excellent.  I have had it for a couple months now, and it still works perfectly.  With heat settings and a nice grip as well.  The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is because they say it's for men.  Makes me laugh.  Still though, worth buying.
