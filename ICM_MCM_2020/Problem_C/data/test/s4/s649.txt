My newborn son would not take a pacifier for the first three weeks of his life.  We tried many different brands (Advent, Mam, etc.) but unlike his older sister who took to the Advent brand on her second day of her life, he did not like it at all. The shape of the pacifier seems more natural to the breastfeed baby. I would strongly recommend this pacifier to all mothers that are breastfeeding.  We are so thankful that we found this pacifier, especially at 2 in the morning!!
