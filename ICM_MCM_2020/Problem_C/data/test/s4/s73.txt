I like the design of the Jerdon Wall Mount Hair Dryer. It's compact and easy to install on the wall. The double buttons make it easy to use, too. The cons? The dryer doesn't have a cool setting, only high, med, and low, plus the electrical cord is very short and you must install it very close to the outlet.
