this is a unique microwave in style and performance.<br />it doesn't heat as high as most, but the size and shape is<br />what sold me.  it fits nicely into a corner of my counter.<br />i don't use a microwave for much other than reheating<br />things, so this for me is perfect.  it is a very basic microwave.<br />i really like that the light goes off after a bit if you leave the door open.
