We have twins, and they LOVE their WubbaNubs.  We have many different versions (Kitty Cat, Bear, Frog, etc.) but the Dog is the absolute favorite and we must have 2 available at all times.  This will be the 4th (or possible 5th?) Dog WubbaNub we have purchased.  I'm not sure if it's because he's their favorite or something about the design of this one, but the silicone tab that connects the stuffed dog to the pacifier starts tearing much faster than any of the other versions we own and must be replaced more often.  I can't wait until we are done with pacifiers so I don't have to replaced them anymore but until then, the Brown Puppy is our twins 'bink' of choice!
