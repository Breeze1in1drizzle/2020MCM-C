This is a good hair dryer.  It gets the job done better than other blow dryers I have tried for my 4a, 4b textured ethnic hair.  I had another model of an Andis hair dryer that looked similar to this particular Andis style dryer and it was better than this one as it blow dryed my hair so well that I didn't even need to flat iron my hair a lot of times because it was that efficient with the proper amount of heat combined with the fine tooth comb attachment (without causing heat damage).  This dryer still a relief for me as I had been going without a good blow dryer for a while and this one works for my hair compared to other brands.
