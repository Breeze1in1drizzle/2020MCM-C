This dryer is works really well on my thick (African American and Mexican American) hair and very quickly. I bought it mainly because of the comb attachment. It's slightly heavier than other hair dryers but is also more visually appealing. If you switch attachments while you dry your hair this isn't or you, they get very hot. Hope this helps.
