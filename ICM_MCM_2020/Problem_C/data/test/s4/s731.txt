This case is very convenient and durable. The only issue i had with it is that soothies will not fit into it. It only works with the regular shaped pacifiers like MAM and NUK, etc. That being said, once my son decided he didn't like the soothies anymore and switched to the MAM pacis, it works perfectly.
