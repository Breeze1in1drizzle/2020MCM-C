Before purchasing, I read other reviews. I have now used both products on my 3 month old daughter. The thermometer works great, and is very easy to use. I confirmed the temperature reading with two other thermometers (both used under the arm), and had the same reading on all three. The medicine dispenser works as other reviewers say - the hole opening for the liquid is bigger and is a straight hole from the liquid to the pacifier's end. The pacifier is hard plastic, not soft like a typical pacifier. Your child won't be able to gently suck the medicine out - it will drain out into his mouth. This wasn't a problem (choking or otherwise) for my 3M daughter as she doesn't choke easily and usually nurses quickly.
