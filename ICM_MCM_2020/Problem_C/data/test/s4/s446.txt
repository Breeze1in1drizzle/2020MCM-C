I spent more money on this dryer than I have any other before. Was it worth the price? I don't think so.<br /><br />It is a decent dryer....super fast drying...so if you have thick hair, you'll love it. My problem is I have thin, fine hair and I'd prefer a lower setting. I can use the &#34;Scalp setting&#34; but even that is a bit powerful. I like a lower setting to style my hair better. This just blows it in all directions. I don't see that much difference to be honest in the end result as I get with any other dryer.<br /><br />I won't send it back...does the job but I still like my old dryer best which is no longer made.
