I really like the pacifiers and surprisingly my son did too. I hadn't been able to find one that he like and he seemed to like this one. They came in a pack of two in a nice plastic container. The quality of the pacifiers is really nice. The only thing that I did not like was that I received pink ones. It would have been nice to be given the option to choose the color. Now my son has a pink pacifier. I will be giving the other away since I have no use for it. Overall i loved this pacifier just not the color I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
