My son loves this pacifier!  He is four months old and is learning how to grab the frog, not just the pacifier part.  It soothes him!  He was given the soothies pacifier in the NICU, and I just never bought him any other brand, so when I saw this, I thought it was so cute!  I can even put it in the sanitizer.  The only thing that I don't like is that you can't take the pacifier off.  It is sewn on.  Other than that, it is great and I would recommend it.
