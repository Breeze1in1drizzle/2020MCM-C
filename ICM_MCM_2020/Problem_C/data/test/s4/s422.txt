I needed to replace my professional-grade hair dryer, and I was considering all my options. I wasn't sure that I wanted to spend a significant amount of money, so I tried this model, which had fairly good reviews.<br /><br />It's fairly quiet. It is not as powerful as my old dryer, but it is significantly lighter and seems to be constructed well. So far, so good.
