This little sucker has been heating up our food reliably for going on a year. It fit into a cabinet space that no other microwave could fit into. Yeah, it's a little underpowered, but you get used to that.<br /><br />It fits a whole plate, which is nice, but sometimes if you have a larger item it will catch against the wall and not rotate. Full-size popcorn bags have this problem for example.<br /><br />But overall, great option if you need a microwave to fit into a very small space.
