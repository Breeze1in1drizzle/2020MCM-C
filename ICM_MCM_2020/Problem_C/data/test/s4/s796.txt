I love that this is an all natural material pacifier. My baby will take it once in a while for nap time and likes it the best over other pacifiers but she isn't a huge fan. The reason I think she doesn't like (and the reason I don't like it) is because of its smell.. it smells like a latex glove. Unfortunately there's no way around it. After I sterilized it I rubbed coconut oil on it and rinsed, it helped but didn't fully get rid of the smell.<br />Other than the smell, it's great! It touches baby's nose, so for breastfed babies it's more natural feeling and there's no yucky, questionable ingredients.. that's why I bought it!
