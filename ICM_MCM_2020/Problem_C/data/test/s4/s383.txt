I liked the hair dryer. It's  1875w the same as my old hair dryer but the air seems to come out with more force. It's not too heavy which is good because I'm a weakling, the cord is long enough, it's easy to hold and dries hair very quickly! The only problem for me was the switches on the side instead of in the front because they were right where I hold the dryer and I was accidentely hitting them the whole time changing the setting which was very annoying! Overall, it was a good powerful hair dryer if you are able to deal with the switch placement.
