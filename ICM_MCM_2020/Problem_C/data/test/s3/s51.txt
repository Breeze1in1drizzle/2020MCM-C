Pros:   <br />1. This blow dryer is great for the price.  Just don't expect a $100+ ionic dryer.  You get a nice $18 dryer for $18 - simple. <br />2. Nice looking, sleek design, with retractable cord.  This is not a compact dryer for travel - it should be considered more of a mid-size. <br /> <br />Cons: <br />1.  Retractable cord is quite short, which could be a problem if your outlet is not very close by.   <br />2.  Very loud!  I saw others complain about this, and now I know what they mean.  It's loud.  <br />3.  The retractable cord failed to retract after a couple of uses.  This is disappointing considering it was a major factor in my purchase. <br /> <br />Bottom Line: <br />Does it dry hair quickly and make it smooth and silky??  No more than any other dryer.  It's a nice, inexpensive, blow dryer, but I personally would not purchase it again. <br />
