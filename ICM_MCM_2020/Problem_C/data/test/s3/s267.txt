this is a quality hair dryer, no doubt about that. But in my search to replace an old and cheap one, i didn't consider the size and weight of these newer, salon quality ones. Very impressed when i received it, but found it quite heavy and loud, due to a more powerful motor w/ multiple features. The mid-heat setting, which i was really looking forward to ( having only 'unbearably hot' on my prior dryer) was actually pretty cool and the warm setting not really that warm. maybe that's something to get used to, but didn't seem to dry my hair that fast. the other issue for me was simply that the dryer was so much larger that it wouldn't fit in my vanity drawer, and with no other storage option, had to find a model that fit.
