I wanted something basic, relatively inexpensive, reasonably well made, and sturdy that would dry and style my hair quickly.  That is almost exactly what I got.  My only real issues with the dryer is the flimsy switch and lint trap cover.  The switch doesn't click into a new setting crisply. You have to go slowly and gently with the switch control in order to get any setting other than off or the highest heat/fan position.  The lint trap cover just pops off and takes some careful fussing around to replace securely.  Sometimes even if you think you have it back on correctly it will pop back off a few seconds later.
