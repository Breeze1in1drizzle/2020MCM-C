I loved the idea of this pacifier, enough to shell out the money it cost.  We started my baby on the soothie but he never could keep it in his mouth.  After experimenting with a cheap-o luvs orthodontic pacifier I decided the orthodontic shape would work much better.      First off, the rubber discolored when I sterilized it.  I don't know if that makes a difference, but it came out with a white tinge to it.  He took it right away and the shaped nipple helped keep it in but because the shield hits his nose, it still falls out easily.  The shields that are shaped to the face seem to help him keep it in more easily.  Another flaw is that the loop sticks out from his face, and since my son grabs at everything he can, he keeps pulling it out of his mouth.      Maybe if he wasn't in such a grabby stage or was more able to keep it in his mouth I would have liked it better.  We ended up getting a MAM [[ASIN:B00211NRF6 Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone Pacifier - Size 1 - 0-6 months - boy colors]] and he loves it.  It isn't all natural but it is BPA free, and very very pretty.
