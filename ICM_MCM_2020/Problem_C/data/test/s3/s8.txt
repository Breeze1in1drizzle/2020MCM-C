I had a Conair hair dryer that gave out finally due to usage and age.<br />This one was powerful enough but since I have thick shoulder length<br />hair, it takes longer to dry and the Conair automatically shut down.<br />I had to wait until it cooled down to be able to turn it on again.  I sent<br />it back because I do not have time to waste until the hair dryer could<br />operate again.  Handy size, but too many minuses.
