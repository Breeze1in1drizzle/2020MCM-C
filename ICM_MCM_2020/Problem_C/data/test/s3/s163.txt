This dryer is just cheap.  Cheap, lightweight, plasticky feeling.  Granted, it IS all of those things but I have a much nicer travel hair dryer that doesn't feel like it is just going to snap in two...unfortunately my other one doesn't have a diffuser which is the sole reason I got this one.  But hey, it's only for travel...
