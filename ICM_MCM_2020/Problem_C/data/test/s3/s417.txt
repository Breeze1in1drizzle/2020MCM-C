i like these pacifiers and i'm sure they are a good product. unfortunately my baby is used to the soothie pacifiers and don't not take to these. these pacifiers constantly pop out of his mouth as he's trying to suck on them. he will try to hold it in his mouth but the pacifier will continue to pop out. i will keep trying to offer these to him in hopes that he gets used to it as i've already spent money on two packages!
