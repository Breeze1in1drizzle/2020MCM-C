this type of nipple works on the glass bottles from avent, and, since i wanted to avoid using the plastic bottles, i had to get these nipples. in the advertisement it is claimed that these nipples assure natural flow with a twin anti-colic valves. and, when the flow actually flows the nipples work fine. however, i had thrown out two of the nipples out of pure frustration when the formula would not flow! this never happened with the previous type of nipples from philips that came with the plastic bottles. why would the flow work some times and not others i have no idea, but here is what i do now: there are small grooves on the opposite edges of the nipple (one of them right by the number indicator), so i align one of the grooves with the small notch in the plastic screw-cap thing that attaches the nipple to the bottle. this works most of the time, and if the flow gets stuck, i push on the nipple with the finger at the place where the groove meets the notch and blow at it for a second or two. that seems to solve the flow issue and all is well again. how is this a natural flow? well it sort-of works, and you really haven't got much choice if you use the glass bottle from philips, but this nipple issue has be to resolved at some point.
