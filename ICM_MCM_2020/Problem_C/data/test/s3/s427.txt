This is a great product idea. I mean, how many times does the little one drop his pacifier? All the time! And you surely don't want to have to wash it a million times a day (hoping the germs get off that way)... or maybe you just pick up the pacifier and blow it off then hand it back... but, the solution to this is the Pipila. It's a great idea. In just moments the pacifier is sterilized and ready to go back to baby. However, for $35 I expect something a little more sturdy that this gizmo. I am on the fence as whether or not to recommend this product to anyone because of this; hence the three stars. If it were built stronger I would definitely give it more  stars and a high recommendation.
