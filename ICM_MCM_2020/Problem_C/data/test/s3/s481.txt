Let me start off with this.. I do like it, it makes it easy to access the binky at a moments notice but....for the price it isn't worth it... I can barely fit 2 binkys in it, I initially put in on the diaper bag where it was shown on the photo, on the arm, yeah... It slide everywhere and drove me nots, now it is in my bag, which makes it hard to find...other than function, which is why I bought it it is cute..even though nobody cam see it...if it was a dollar I would say it was worth in but not for what I paid for it....
