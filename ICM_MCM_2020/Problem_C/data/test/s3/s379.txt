My daughter loves these, and I love having something that she will use. The only thing that bothers me is that after they have been used a little, when they dry they begin to look kind of white, almost like there is baby powder on them. I do not know if this is normal, or if it is from the soap I use, but after they look that way I throw them out. They are great, I just wish I either knew why this was happening, or that it did not happen, so that they would last longer.
