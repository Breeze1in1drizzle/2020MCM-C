I bought this hairdryer for an upcoming trip and wanted something compact yet efficient.  After several uses, the cord stopped retracting all the way, and instead, only goes in about 2/3 of the total length.  I expected this to happen eventually although I was hoping that it would be later rather than sooner.  So now I have a hairdryer that still folds but only retracts most of the cord, leaving about 1/3 hanging out.  Other than the cord retraction issue, it is a great hairdryer.
