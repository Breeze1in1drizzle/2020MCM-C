I really love the concept of this toy/pacifier. And I love how many models you can choose from! It is such a good idea to combine a pacifier with a plush toy. So cute, and so convenient to take in the car, or to give baby at night. I agree with people who say that the pacifier doesn't stay long in their kid's mouth: my baby, too, pulls the pacifier out of her mouth because she keeps grasping and playing with the giraffe. But that's ok with me, as long as she is having fun with it.<br /><br />However, I have to complain about the poor quality of this item:<br />- I saw someone writing that the plush looked like a happy meal toy. Yes, it does, indeed! It is soft enough for my baby to enjoy, but I still feel that for the price it could be somewhat nicer.<br />- The pacifier is not the best. The shape is actually pretty bad. The base of it shouldn't be round and have a 'cut-out' for the nose, like most other pacifiers do.<br />- I HATE that the plush doesn't detach, it makes it so much more difficult to wash. I would actually have liked it if you could detach the plush to wash it, and why not re-attach it to any pacifier, so that you could change the color of the pacifier, upgrade for a 6+ month pacifier, replace it when it is damaged, etc. I get that they don't want you to buy another brand of pacifier, but couldn't they at least make a system where you can remove and attach to this brand of pacifiers, and sell separate pacifiers and plush toys? Kind of a 'mix-n-match' concept? That would be sooooo great!<br /><br />Would these points be solved (and they are easily solved), it would be one of the best items on the market for a young baby. I also bought one for my godson and he loves his so much, too, but his mom has the exact same issues than I do. Anyhow, I don't regret my purchase but hope that Wubbanub will make this product better before I have another baby...
