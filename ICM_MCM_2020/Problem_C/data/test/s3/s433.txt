My daughter has had a definite paci passion her whole life.  My son never used a paci but my daughter clearly wanted to suck on something that didn't produce milk.  When our fingers were pale and wrinkly from being sucked on, we decided to get a paci for her.  She was blissed out with the soothie (first one we tried) so we stuck with it.  I got her the wubbanub thinking it would be easier for her to hold it and insert it in her mouth herself.  Maybe the problem was that she was already 6 months old when we tried it, but she didn't like how it pulled out of her mouth and would get very frustrated.  She also seems to find the stuffy by her face really annoying.  We're sticking with a paci on a clip.  Maybe starting with an infant would make more sense, though I'm not sure what you'd do when the paci needed replacing and the baby was attached to the stuffy?
