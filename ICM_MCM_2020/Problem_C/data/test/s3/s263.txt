The dryer is working fine so far. There's no question that it is top heavy and the bottom part is more flimsy than I would like. I move it around with care and support it with both hands. For the price I expected to be so. In the future, if I adapt to it, I might fiddle with the design and make it more stable. Do not expect wonders.
