i bought these (not on amazon) at the store today. my son is 3 months old and ebf and has never taken a pacifier and all of a sudden yesterday magically started taking the soothie (he always spit them out and made yuck faces before and would prefer breast, his hand, or my hand). i was so excited, but didn't like how it covered his nose, and in my excitement i ran to the store and bought two gumdrop pacifiers. when i got them out of the package though, i started to wonder if they were really just like the soothie like i had been told. they were heavier, thicker, stiffer, and more plastic-y feeling.  my son does take it, but he isn't as willing to take it and it falls out of his mouth a lot more than the soothie and he won't sleep with it in his mouth.  i must say i am a bit disappointed.
