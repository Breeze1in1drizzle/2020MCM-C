Unit is lighter than expected. Cooks as expected. Door latch is hard to push, but not hard enough to move unit while opening. Light comes on as unit runs, not as door opens. Buttons are convenient for cooking, but read directions, some difference to set power levels, than other microwaves I have owned. Went with this unit, due to reviews, size and price.
