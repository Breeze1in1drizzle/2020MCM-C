I love this dryer but have gone through two in the last year. I always use the defuser with it and the defuser attachment ALWAYS falls off (about 30 times during a blow dry). This dryer works well on frizz when the defuser is staying on, but it is extremely frustrating to constantly stop and reattach it.
