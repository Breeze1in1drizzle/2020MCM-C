I am a hairdresser of 40+ years...needed this for my very occasional jobs at home...it will do the job...easy to store (biggest reason for this choice, over one on wheels)  Somewhat noisy (who cares) WONDERFUL heat...could use some more air holes.  This is not made as good as the one I had to toss that was more than 40 yrs old...but that is true about everything...can't see how it adjusts in height
