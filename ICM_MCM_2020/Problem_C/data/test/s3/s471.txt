I'm sure there are some babies out there that will only use this type of MAM but my son didn't like it. He couldn't keep it in his mouth. So we will be sticking with the other MAM type pacifiers. I don't really know how to rate this because the MAM products are great but my son just didn't like this one so that is why I gave it three stars.
