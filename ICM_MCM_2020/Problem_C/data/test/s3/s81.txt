I know some other reviewers have raved about this hair dryer. For me, it's just okay. It gets the job done. I've got fine, thin hair, so most dryers will do that. And it does keep the static down a bit. I find it heavier and more awkward than my previous Sassoon dryer that used to have an ionizer function but does not now. The switches on this dryer are more difficult to work. They're sliders that are only slightly elevated from the underlying plastic layer and have a narrow slightly elevated lip at on end that I suppose is designed to make them easier to move but doesn't do much for me. It works, and I'm keeping it. But I'm not sure I'd buy it again.
