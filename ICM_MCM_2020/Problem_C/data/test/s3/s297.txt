First the positive: this hairdryer is just the right weight, not so heavy that your arm gets tired during blow drying and not too light either. The color of the model I got is a sort of shimmering raspberry and is beautiful. The cord keeper feature is also pretty handy and so far, after using this dryer every day for almost a week works well. it gets moderately warm and has a somewhat ok power. I definitely wouldn't call it ultra powerful. I have another hairdryer at home which is a little more powerful. It dries my shoulder length hair, start to finish in around 10 minutes. This conair dryer is not hot enough or powerful enough to do that and has taken almost 20 minutes everyday to dry my hair.<br />This hairdryer is perfectly ok if you have shortish, or fine hair and are not in a rush. I will use it on weekends or evenings, but I don't want to get up 10-15 minutes earlier in the morning to get my hair dried.
