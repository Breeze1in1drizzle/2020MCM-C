My nephews get all kinds of funny reactions when they roll around with these in their mouths. Only wish that the nipple part was shaped more ergonomically. Neither one of the twins can hold it in their mouths for long because it's flat on one side and rounded on the other. Wish the seller would post pictures of the nipple so buyers can know if this shape suits their (baby) needs. btw - Does anyone know if and how we can swap the nipples from different pacifiers onto these?
