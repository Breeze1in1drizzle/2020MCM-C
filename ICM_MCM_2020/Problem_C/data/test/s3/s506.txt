The pacifiers were much thicker and harder than expected that the ones that you get from the hospital as a newborn. I decided to get these because my dog had chewed up my sister's pacifier and I had to buy a new one but they would always be sold out in stores and so I resulted to purchasing this. However once I got it my sister didn't like it because it was too hard, although she is 7 months old. She will suck on it for a while and then spit it out due to difficulty sucking on it. Its good for its purchase but I think the 0-3 months pacifier is better.
