I really like the Natursutten pacifiers,however the butterfly pacifier did not wk for my baby because the way is shaped. The cut needs to be a bit deeper because the way they are shaped it makes an indentation on the  baby's nose. I will keep buying the product but  will stick to the round shape for the comfort of my baby. Nothing to do with the seller though...more with the manufacturer.
