We received this product on time and in good condition.  However, after about one month the connector on the bonnet came loose from the bonnet.  Poor job of attaching this during manufacturing.  Now must replace the bonnet and connector and having an awful time finding out where they may be purchased/replaced under warranty.  Does ANYBODY out there have any idea on where to go?[[ASIN:B000BBGS40 Hot Tools Professional 800 Watt Ionic Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer]]
