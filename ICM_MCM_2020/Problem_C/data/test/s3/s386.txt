I have this in black and it works fine for what it is.  It holds a pacifier, nothing more.  However, mine corroded and rusted on the zipper parts.  I don't want rust anywhere near something my child will put in his mouth so I'll be looking for an alternative.  I never submerged it in water, only wiped clean.  I expected higher quality from Skip Hop.
