I loved this pacifier and concept, then the opening cracked after 3 weeks of use.  The nipple material is pretty stiff and I guess that contributed to the cracking.  BUT, before that it was fabulous.  Better than the Numimed by far.  Love being able to push/blow the medicine down when it got stuck in the back.  Hole was small enough so that the medication didn't leak out.  Back snapped closed and open without too much trouble.  Reservoir was a nice size - not too big, not too small.  Great concept, but save your money.  We have just taken to filling a small nipple with the medication and  it works great.
