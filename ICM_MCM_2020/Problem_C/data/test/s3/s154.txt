I like the nozzle attachment, but it can fall off easily which can get annoying.  It has 2 levels of heat settings and 2 levels of cool blow dry settings so that is good, and it is not heavy.  But I recently used a friend's Conair Infinity hairdryer and I actually liked that much better, it dried my hair in less time and it was less frizzy....
