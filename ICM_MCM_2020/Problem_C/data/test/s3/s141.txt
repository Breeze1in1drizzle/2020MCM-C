Chose this dryer because of the good reviews. Has a few annoying features: double buttons (heat and speed) and hard not move both when one only needs to move one. Also not that strong and so doesn't dry very quickly. Finally, sometimes the concentrator falls off. However, it was not expenssive so you get what you pay for.
