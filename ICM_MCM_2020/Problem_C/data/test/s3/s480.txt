The pacifier itself is fine.  I have other versions of this pacifier and bought this &#34;nighttime&#34; version specifically for its glow in the dark feature.  This line of Avent pacifier is pretty light with mostly clear plastic.  Therefore, when you are looking for it in the middle of the night to give it to the baby, it's almost impossible to find it, unless you turn on the lights.  I thought the glow in the dark handle was a great idea and would eliminate the night issue.  Unfortunately, it only glows in the dark for a few minutes after turning the light off.  This defeats the purpose of why I bought the &#34;nighttime&#34; version.
