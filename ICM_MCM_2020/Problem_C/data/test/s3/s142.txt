Overall this hairdryer does the job well; its 1875 and powerful will dry hair quickly.  I have two issues with this dryer:  1.  the air concentration nossel is wide and does not attach well to the hairdryer therefore any slight bump with either your hand or your brush will make it fly off and it does so at least 3 times when I'm drying my hair; its really irritating and 2.  the cool shot button is right at the top of the handle where I usually hold the hair dryer this makes it akward to hold because I dont want the cool shot button on to I have to hold the dryer at the bottom of the handle.
