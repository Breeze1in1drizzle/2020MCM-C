I loved this microwave's size and shape but in the last month (4/2016) I had two sparking incidents, luckily I was in the kitchen and got it unplugged quickly.  I just threw it out. Today I was looking online to see when I bought it (April 2013) and if anyone else had reported similar issues.   I see that there are similar reviews so don't think Ill buy another even tho I like the size and shape.   UPDATED 4/2016  it was hard to find a small microwave that didnt look cheap, this looks nice and works great, a keeper
