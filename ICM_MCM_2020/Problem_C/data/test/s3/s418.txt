I had high hope for these pacifiers as we always struggle to find her binkies late at night. It does not glow in the dark after turning off the light for 30 minutes. It defeats the purpose of these glow in the dark pacifier. Not only that but it also too big. The design is very awkward. It does not mold to mouth. No curves whatsoever. I would not purchase these binkies again. My daughter also hates these!
