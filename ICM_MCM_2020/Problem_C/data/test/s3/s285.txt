I was definitely skeptical of the claims of this dryer's nanoe technology. But surprisingly, my hair feels smoother and more conditioned than normal (as if I used extra conditioner or just done a treatment). The dryer dries quickly with strong blast without being too noisy. It looks sleek and, despite the size, doesn't feel overly heavy. The weight is well balanced. The cold blast feature works as expected. The issues I had was with the sliding button controls which can be a little stiff. Also, I have straight, moderately thick hair and the 'conditioning' effect sometimes flatten my hair. Hair can feel too soft that there's not enough 'lift' and bounce. This is great when hair is brittle and frizzy. Not so great on humid days. Curly hair may not have this issue. So far, the biggest drawback is definitely the price.
