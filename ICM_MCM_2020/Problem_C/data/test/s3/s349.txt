Since we only use a microwave to heat or reheat food, I decided to forgo all the bells and whistles when our last one stopped working. This one was the lowest priced one that met the color, size and wattage I wanted.<br />Pros: Heats food as expected.<br />Cons: Noisy<br />While the microwave works fine for it's intended purpose, it's extremely noisy compared to our previous microwaves and occasionally makes an odd rumbling sound which may be from it not sitting level since one leg is shorter than the others. I attempted to adjust the leg without success so tucked a piece of folded cardboard under it to keep the microwave somewhat level. Also at first the door was extremely difficult to push open, but that has gotten better with use.
