I can't say I am disappointed, but my last Conair was better.  However, it burnt out within a year, possibly because I dropped it, but this time I didn't want to spend too much cash to replace it and that one is no longer available.  FYI--The one I had and bought on Amazon was:  Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black<br /><br />I selected this one because I was so pleased with the last one.<br /><br />The color and functionality of this dryer are it's best features.  It probably makes a better &#34;travel&#34; dryer than anything.  It doesn't allow you to adjust the temp (cool, warm, hot), but it does have a cold shot button.  You can only choose High or Low speeds.  I totally missed those details in the online description that before my purchase.  I did watch the video and it is what sold me, but the video makes this dryer look more powerful than it really is.  Perhaps if you don't have thick hair like me it would perform more to my liking.<br /><br />In my opinion, I don't think it is even close to salon performance.  It says it uses ion technology, but my last Conair that was labeled ionic worked so much better and dried my hair faster with hardly any frizz.  This gets the job done, It dries my hair pretty fast, but my hair is very frizzy after which annoys me.  I will probably take the plunge and buy a higher-end hair dryer in the future, until then, this is OK and will get me through!
