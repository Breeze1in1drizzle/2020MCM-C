I gave this paci to my Daughter when she was only a couple weeks old and she really liked it.  I was breastfeeding and liked the idea that it was like mother.  The problem with this paci is that where the soft latex and hard plastic meets there is a seam that saliva can get into.  Over time it gets funky in there and mold can grow.  Unfortunately, you can't take apart the binky in order to clean it. Even boiling them didn't work. I did end up using these until my daughter was 1.  I just watched them and threw them out when they started to get weird. So if you don't mind cycling through binkies every few months then give these a try...
