This pacifier is a good idea and works well. As described, it does close when dropped, keeping it clean. The plastic outside of the device is bulky and seemingly uncomfortable for my baby, however. There is little air movement between the pacifier and the skin, like other pacifiers, due to how this pacifier must be designed to close when dropped. Overall a good product.
