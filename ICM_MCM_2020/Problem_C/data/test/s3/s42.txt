I really wanted to love this dryer as it comes highly recommended by professional stylists.  I used it twice, it dried my hair quickly and somewhat smooth using a ceramic ion brush.  I was pleased with the results, after all this was a big step up from the half broken one I purchased from Sally's years ago.  Then I visited my mother who recently purchased a new drier, the rusk w8less.  She told me I should try it.  When I used the rusk I was amazed at how fast it dried my hair and how  smooth and silky my hair felt.  I was in LOVE!!! It was a huge step up from the twinturbo.  I had to have the rusk, so I returned the twinturbo.  I could not be happier w the customer service.  Refund was super smooth.  So for the drier 3 stars customer service via Amazon and the seller 5 stars.<br /><br />Pros:  Dries fast, smooth results, nice button position.<br /><br />Cons: Heavy, the wind screen on the back has no cover, just flimsy screen. On both occasions I used the drier my long hair was sucked into the screen, causing it to tangle and burn.  In my opinion this is a design flaw. The hole in the back of the dryer is the circumference of my fist!<br /><br />Look to the rusk w8less!  It's an outstanding dryer!
