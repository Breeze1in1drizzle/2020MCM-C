I bought this pacifier because my 3 year old had it when he was a baby and he was hooked with it.  then i bought it for my second child because he liked the binky playtex nipples a soon as it shipped he lost interest in the binky.  I guess it a good thing because it not great for their growing teeth.  Waste of money this time.
