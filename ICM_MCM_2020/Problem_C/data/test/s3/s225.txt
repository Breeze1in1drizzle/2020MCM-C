I purchased this dryer a year ago and it has performed very well. I did go onto Amazon and  order the Babybliss tonight because this dryer has started sparking. When I am drying my hair I hear and see sparks. Crazy so I threw it away and researched reviews on several sites and ordered the Babybliss. I do not want to wait until this dryer burns my hair.
