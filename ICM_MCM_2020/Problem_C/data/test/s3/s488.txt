Slightly disappointed with the size of then nipple.  We got the 0-6 mos size and the nipple was super small.  We got another one with the round shape but same size and the nipple was perfect.  Maybe we got a defect one. But I do like the butterfly shape so it isn't putting up against my little one's nose.
