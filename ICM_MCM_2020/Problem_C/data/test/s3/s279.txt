Purchased this without much research, so I am to blame for not &#34;loving&#34; this.  It's heavy, loud and I prefer more ranges in heat than it offers.  The attachments work well.  It's mid-sized, so if you're wanting something light and small, this isn't it.  Mid-sized and heavy......I would not buy again.
