I like this hair dryer, but it's just not well suited for a man's use - especially in the gym.  I had purchased it to dry my hair during the winter months.  It is not overly loud and provides a high volume of air - too much to manage the shorter hair most men wear.  It's also much heavier than I expected it to be.  I decided to go with a model with a comb and brush attachment.<br /><br />A word of caution concerning the folding handle on this unit.  The first time I used it I had my forefinger too close to the top of the handle and it pinched the heck out of me.  I still have a sore spot on my finger a week later.  Be careful when opening.
