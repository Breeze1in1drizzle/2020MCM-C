This product is okay. My son seemed to like them alright. We had to wait till he was a little bigger to use them because they covered his nose at first. This paci is a little stiffer and a bit longer than some others but the baby doesn't seem to mind. We much rather prefer the Gum Drop Pacifiers by Hawaii Medical, but these have been a good back up when my others are all over the place or being steam sterilized. They do fade a bit when sterilized but the Gum Drops do as well.
