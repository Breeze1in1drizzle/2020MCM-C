This exact microwave model was custom installed by our home builder using a trim kit. The manufacturing date on the unit was August 2012.  We moved in the house and began using the microwave in April 2013. The operation and capabilities were more than satisfactory.  I purchased a 4 year warranty extension in April 2013 through Whirlpool but is actually backed by Assurant Service Protection, Inc.<br /><br /> In July 2014, the microwave ceased to heat. I contacted the service department at Assurant who connected me with a local appliance repair business.  The appliance repair technician advised that this microwave unit is not serviceable.  So I went back to Assurant, who after several calls, offered approximately 75% of the cost of a new microwave as outlined in their service contract. If it had been within the first year of ownership, a new microwave would have been provided to me.<br /><br />The four year service contract cost $129.  The offer was for $178.  If I had it do again, I would have purchased a one year warranty extension for $30 instead of the four year warranty extension.<br /><br />I am going to replace the failed microwave with the same model so I can retain the custom trim and cabinetry in the kitchen.  I will purchase a 1 year extension so that I can repeat the replacement if necessary in a couple of years.  (I also ordered some parts for $30 through Amazon and will try, as an experiment, to repair the failed microwave.)
