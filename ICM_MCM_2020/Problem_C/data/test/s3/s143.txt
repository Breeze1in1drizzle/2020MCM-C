There are many reviews for this dryer, and in a nut shell, it works very well and does the job. I have two small complaints, but one of them is a big deal for me. I have medium textured straight hair that is very, very long. I like to use the medium heat setting for blow drying my hair for less damage but this dryers medium heat, is almost room temperature. It's not quite hot enough and therefore takes about 50% longer than my old dryer to get the job done.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-nice feel in the hand<br />-nice frizz/flyaway control<br />-Low and high air flow<br />-3 temp. settings<br />-comes with diffuser<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Medium heat is too cool causing long drying time<br />-the precision diffuser knocks off the dryer fairly easily with an accidental tap of the brush, or wrapping of the chord<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy the same one again, but really, it's just a hair dryer!
