I picked these pacifiers because of the cute animal designs, it said that the style/color may vary but I thought that meant within the styles/colors shown. The ones I received are totally plain and boring. Since its such a small purchase I can't even return them so now I just have these boring blah pacifiers for my new baby. I'm sure they'll work fine but if you're getting them because of the unique cute little animals be warned.
