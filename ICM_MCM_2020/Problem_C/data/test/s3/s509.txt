I have a lot of trouble finding this kind of paci in stores.  I wish I hadn't gave my son this kind because he won't take any other now.  They are great pacifiers though.  Also don't get your hopes up on the color you want.  my son got pink.  It's not a big deal but some moms are very picky. I was just pretty desperate because I can never find these at local stores so I didn't care about the color.
