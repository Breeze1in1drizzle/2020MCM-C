Pros: Nice design, gets the dryer off the counter, dryer works very well, and is lightweight.<br /><br />Cons: They don't last very long.  I've had 2 of these: First one lasted 27.5 months used an average of 1.5 times/day.  Second one only lasted 22 months with same use frequency.  I've had other blow dryers last 10+ years, so its annoying that this product does not last.  The fan blades inside the dryer are made of very thin plastic, and they eventually just disintegrate.<br /><br />Summary: I would be happy to pay more for a dryer that works, looks and functions as well, but lasts longer.
