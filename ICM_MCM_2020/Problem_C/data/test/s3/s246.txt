Love the metallic green, and the dryer ample job. The cold shot is also a helpful feature. However, I was expecting a much different hair dryer. The cord does not retract into the handle as advertised. Also, the dryer is much larger and heavier than I hoped it would be. It also would would have been nice to have the diffuser attachment to create funkier hair styles. The travel bag is well made. Truthfully, it's too big and heavy for me to use it for travel.
