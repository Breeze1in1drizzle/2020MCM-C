We had this one in newborn size and liked it a lot until our little one got her teeth at 6 m and bit them through. I order these in size 12+ in hope that they are much sturdy and can hold, but they are as soft as the newborn size and get bit through within a day. It doesn't happen with other brand of rubber pacifiers.
