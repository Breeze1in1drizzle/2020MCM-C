This is my only experience with an ionic hair dryer, so I have nothing with which to compare this one.  However, I bought it because I had several expections about its features.  Here is how each feature measured up:<br />Quicker?  NO.  It may even take a little longer than a standard 1875-watt dryer.  The reason is that the fan does not blow very hard.  The high setting blows about like the low setting on a standard dryer.<br />Reduced frizz/flyaways/static? YES.  These are significantly reduced.<br />Increased shine?  YES.  My hair is visibly shinier.<br />Quieter?  YES, but qualified.  The only reason it is quieter is because it doesn't blow air as hard as a regular dryer.<br />Freshens hair?  YES.  <br />Another drawback:  This dryer is very heavy.  It took me several days to get used to how heavy it is.<br />This dryer delivers almost all of what ionic hairdryers promise, but I was mostly hoping for a dryer to speed drying time.  If you have thin hair or hair that dries quickly or have plenty of time to dry your hair, then I would highly recommend this dryer.  My hair looks shinier and healthier.
