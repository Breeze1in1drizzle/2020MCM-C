My 14 months old baby boy loves MAM latex pacifiers, when i wanted to buy new ones I came across these, and were glad I did;  he absolutely loves them, there very easy to clean (water doesn't get trapped in).<br />then two weeks later he bit through them( I bought 4),  the other latex ones survived 8 months with no damage.<br />maybe they are just too thin? I don't know but what a waste of money!
