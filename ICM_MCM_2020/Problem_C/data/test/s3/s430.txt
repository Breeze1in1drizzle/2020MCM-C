The description does state this will fit two pacifiers, but it really depends on their size.  I have regular pacifiers with the plastic shield and Avent Soothies, and the Soothies were the only ones where I could cram two of them in there.  For regular pacifiers with the plastic shield you can only fit one.  That's not such a problem for me, but the description really should be a bit more accurate.  The pacifiers I have are the newborn size, so if you get a bigger pacifier there's even less space for it.  On the plus side, it does seem to lock pretty well.  I did have trouble opening it from the tab at the top; a work around it so just squeeze the sides and it pops right open.  It has an open side on the clip, which allows you to easily attach it to something.  I also bought the NUK carrier, and it's pretty much the same thing (just more expensive).  Size wise, it also only fits one pacifier so if you're looking for something to fit two pacifiers, you will need to keep looking (or just use a Ziploc bag).
