I have normal to fine long hair, and while this dryer has dramatically shortened my drying time, my biggest issue is that it turns my dried hair into a tangly mess. A hairbrush literally rips my hair out after drying. I haven't had this issue with a dryer before, and an at-home coconut oil treatment has helped the situation somewhat, so I've decided to keep the dryer until my next haircut to see if that alleviates the tangles. If not, I will probably buy a new dryer.
