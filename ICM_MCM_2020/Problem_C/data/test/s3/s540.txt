this pacifier would of been great if i had given it too my daughter when she was younger.  i was tired of cleaning of pacifiers that she drops at 10 months and found this one.  she didn't take to it as she was used to the old one.  i love how it closes when it hits the ground.  however, when she picks it up off the ground she can't open it back up to reuse and tries to stick the whole thing w/ the plastic cover back into her mouth and that doesn't work well.  so i don't use it as pacifier anymore it is more of a toy when we are shopping that she plays with trying to open and close!
