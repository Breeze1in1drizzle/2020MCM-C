This is an okay microwave if you have an extremely small kitchen.<br />CONS:<br />The outside of the microwave is nice and sleek; however, I know the door push button opener won't last because it already has to be pushed several times to get the microwave's door to open. The next issue I have is the cardboard piece that is screwed on the inside of the unit. (I really think this is a hazard, not a good idea, and not hygienic if food splatters on it. Next cons were how cheap the turntable holder is and how much extra time it takes to microwave foods. (Frozen Stauffers TV dinner took 9 minutes to cook!) Likewise, if you like to cook microwave popcorn I suggest you use the mini bags with this one...larger bags had too many kernels left or burned if I tried to get most of the kernels cooked.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Very quiet when operating.<br />Perfect size for my 6x8 sq ft galley  style kitchen.<br />Very sleek and the stainless steel accents are beautiful.<br />Has an interior light.<br />Loud alarm to warn you when cooking is complete.<br />It's quite heavy even though it is a compact size. So it won't fly across the counter if you press a button too hard.<br />Lots of preset functions and an easy to understand owner's manual.<br /><br />I thought GE was a great appliance maker...remembering my mother's GE appliances lasting 20+ years! This one I pray it last for the rest of this year! Also, this microwave is a lot cheaper on Wal-mart website $60 with free in-store shipping. Just a heads up if you still want to purchase one of these microwaves!
