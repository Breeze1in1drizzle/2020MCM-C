When my baby looses the pacifier at night I'm having a hart time to find it in the dark. The clear material is absolutely invisible on our crib mattress cover with colorful patterns.<br />The glow feature is also not working at all. The handle stay illuminated only for few minutes after exposure to a very strong light, which we try to avoid at night time when putting baby to bed, however. During the day it's mostly OK, but definitely not good for night time.
