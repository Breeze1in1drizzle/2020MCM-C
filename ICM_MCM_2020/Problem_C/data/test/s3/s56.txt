This product came up in a search for travel hair dryers.  It is NOT a travel hair dryer.  On the down side:  Heavy (probably because of the cord retracting mechanism, which is powerful enough to pull a tooth with), handle is uncomfortable to hold and is very thick.  The bulbous end of it is so wide it cannot fit in the drawer where I keep hair dryers. And it's a ittle too loud.  On the good side: Does a truly fine job of drying and styling hair, and I really like the results. The price is fair.
