I love Avent pacifiers and have used them with both of my children. I saw a friend with one & thought I definitely needed a pacifier that would glow in the dark! Very disappointed. It doesn't glow unless left in the light and even then only glows for maybe 30 minutes. I thought that by the looks of it that at least some of the stars would glow but no, just the ring. If you just want a pacifier then buy this but if you want one that you can find in the dark, don't expect this one to be what you're looking for.
