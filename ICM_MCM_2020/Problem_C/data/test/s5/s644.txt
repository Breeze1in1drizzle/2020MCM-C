This is our third Oster Wall Hair Dryer.  We've used them in hotels while on business trips and thought it would be great to have one at home.      We love these hair dryers because they are easy to use and efficient.  We don't have to reach under the bathroom sink to pull it out every morning or find a place to plug it in without bumping into anything else on the counter.  It takes up very little space on the wall and is very easy to install.
