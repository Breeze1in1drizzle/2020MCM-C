My wife & I were given a Clifford version of this as a gift. As we started to lose track of clifford, from the car, crib, grandparents house etc., I knew that I had to grab a new one.<br /><br />The WubbaNub is great. Soft animal for my baby to rub her fingers on, while soothing binky to help her sleep or relax.<br /><br />Some complain that the binky doesnt detach, and it's not safe to wash - however hand washing the binky and animal is acceptable. If  you want a detached binky do not buy this.<br /><br />If you know what you want, and what your kid likes, this is perfect. I will be getting more of these for my baby & any future kids I have/ my family or friends have. No doubts, or problems at all.
