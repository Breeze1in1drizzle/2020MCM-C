My $160 blow dryer burned out on vacation.  I really could not afford to spend that kind of money again, but I have curly hair so having a good blower to straighten out my hair is important.  This one was cheaper, but I had never heard of the brand before so I was hesitant, but after researching and reading the reviews, I figured I would go for it.  All I can say is I love it!  It's quiet, it's light, it has alot of heat settings, the buttons are positioned well, and it works better than my old blow dryer as far as straightening my hair.  My boyfriend who also uses it, even commented on how much he likes it, and he is one picky kind of guy.
