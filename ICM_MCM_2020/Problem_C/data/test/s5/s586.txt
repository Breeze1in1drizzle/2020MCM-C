My old hair dryer was a Conair 1875 that I purchased about 10 yrs ago and still works but started to make noises. So I figured it was time to look for a new hair dryer. I purchased this Conair 22NP Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875 and it is even better than my old one. It's light and comfortable to hold while styling and drying my hair. It dries my hair in 1/2 the time of my old one and my hair looks a lot better. I would recommend this hair dryer to anyone who is looking for a new hair dryer. It's a great product and you won't be disappointed.
