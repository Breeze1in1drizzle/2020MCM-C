Both my kids use this binky and now it has been discontinued.  They changed the whole style and shape of the &#34;binky&#34; brand, and it is nowhere near the same.  I have tried a lot of different binkys and my kids only want THIS one.  So what am I to do? Pay a ton for them on Amazon or Ebay, that's what.
