I bought this dryer for travel but  I am using it regularly at home.  It's good weight although it's not lighter than my 'regular' dryer.  I had hoped for a little less weight but I like it anyway.  I also noticed that it is far quieter than my old dryer.  Although not essential, it was good to find something besides black...why are colors so hard to find?  This is definitely a 'thumbs up&#34; product.
