A blow dyrer that gets the job done. I have very thick hair that requires a lot of heat. The Andis 1875 Watt provided that and what would normally take about 30 minutes only took 15.  The comb attachment is heavy duty and durable. I dropped it on the floor twice before using it and it remained intact.  I will say the dryer is on the heavy side but I didn't care because I'd finally found a PROFESSIONAL grade, affordable, and durable hair dryer.
