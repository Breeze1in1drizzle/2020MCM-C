I bought this when my Conair travel dryer finally gave up after nearly a decade.  I purchased this specific dryer because of the retractable cord, and love it!  The added benefit is that it dries my hair so quickly, but it was the cord feature that sold me.  Warning: as the previous reviewer mentioned, cats don't like this dryer.  When the cord retracts it must sound like the retracting cord on my vacuum cleaner because my 13 year old cat flies off the bathroom counter as soon as I pull the cord to plug it in.  Otherwise, it's a great little dryer.
