Some newborns are picky. Mine was one of those newborns. We tried pacifier after pacifier and this was the only one she would take. So we stuck with it!<br /><br />They seem safe enough to use regularly. She pretty much only uses them when she falls asleep, but we've never felt uncomfortable with her using them. The colors are bright and fun, and the clear plastic is simple and modern.<br /><br />A word of advice-- as your baby gets older, keep an eye on how they play with their pacifier. At about four months my baby could fit a lot of this pacifier into her mouth, which freaked me out. Don't forget to move up to the next size (they make 3-6 and 6+) when it's time!
