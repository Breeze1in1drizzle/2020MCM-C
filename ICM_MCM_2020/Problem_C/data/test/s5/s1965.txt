My son (currently 3.5 months old) only likes the Avent Soothie pacifiers, so when I found these, I was very excited. They aren't the cheapest, but it was worth the money. Before my son could grab, I would put this on his chest, and it would stay close to him even when he spit out the pacifier (and he was less likely to spit it out because the kitten held it some). Now that he is learning to use his hands, he loves to grab the kitten and pull whatever part of it he grabs (usually a foot) into his mouth. To wash it, I just throw it into the washing machine with his clothes and let it air dry. It turns out great. The kitten is high quality and should hold up to quite a bit of stress as he gets older. When it drops to the floor, it doesn't bounce like the pacifier would without the kitten, so I haven't lost it in the 2 months we've been using it.
