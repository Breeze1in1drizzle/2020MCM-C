I purchased my previous dryer from my stylist but it was so heavy I quit using it.  The Pearl Ceramic dryer has the same features but is considerably lighter and works wonders with my naturally curly hair.  It dries my hair really quickly and that is what we use them for, especially in southern humidity! Both the diffuser and the air concentrator are useful for various styles.  I use a little wax mousse and presto! I highly recommend it.
