This has been a lifesaver for us! I've seen a ton of moms and babies with these but didn't know what they were called. A friend had twins and said they couldn't do it without the Wubbanub. We soon learned the only pacifier our daughter liked was an Avent soothie but she would drop it at night. After a few nights of screaming after she knocked it out of her mouth (on purpose?), we sent Grammie and Pop Pop to find a Wubbanub. They brought us &#34;Lamby&#34;. I love the little cross on it. It reminds me to thank God for our precious blessing and she loves it. She actually holds it herself but it can be tucked into a swaddle or shirt.
