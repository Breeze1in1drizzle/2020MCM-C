I've tried the natural rubber pacifiers on all of my children as they were babies, since the materials they're made out of are more natural. Each child has preferred this style of pacifier, so we keep going back to them. They're definitely cheaper than the natural rubber ones. If you try the rubber pacifiers on your baby and he/she doesn't take them, I recommend this kind. They're BPA free and orthodontic. The curvature of the brim is perfect for not rubbing up against baby's nose (a problem in most rubber ones I've tried) and the holes in the brim make it so very little moisture gets trapped between their skin and the pacifier. Also, the smoothness of the plastic brim doesn't irritate their mouths from friction while they're sucking.
