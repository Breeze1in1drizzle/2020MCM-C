I have been looking for a great blow dryer and actually the salon I go to the uses this dryer.  My hairdresser told me that it's a very good blow dryer and it does not damage your hair like the other dryers.  This turbo 3200 dryer dries my hair very quickly and I am happy with the end result.<br /><br />I recommend this dryer to anyone who is looking for a really good dryer.  It's a little expensive, but who cares if it's going to give great results then it's worth the money.
