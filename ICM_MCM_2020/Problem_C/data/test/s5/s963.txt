We first encountered this dryer in a hotel room.  My wife used it and immediately fell in love with it.  Small, but it packs a punch. Plenty heat and plenty air volume.  She simply had to have one since her dryer at home was getting sick.  I checked with Amazon and found the identical model we had used at the hotel.  She loves it and it has performed flawlessly for several months now.  We highly recommend this item.
