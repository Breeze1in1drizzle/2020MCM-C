My husband and I were given two orange newborn GumDrop pacifiers in the hospital and found that our daughter took to them quickly as she needed the additional suckling time and I couldn't be her permanent pacifier.  Before we found that our daughter prefers the GumDrop, we tried the following pacifiers (because we received a ton at my baby showers):   1) Philips Avent Soothie Pacifier - look similar to GumDrop, but doesn't have the nook cutout around the nose  2) NUK latex pacifier and the Nuk silicone - have the angled tip upwards  3) various MAM pacifiers - shorter oval sized stem and silicone  4) Dr. Brown's orthodontic pacifier - angled tip upwards    Our daughter preferred silicone to latex and wasn't picky at first, but once she hit 6 months, she wouldn't take any of the others than her GumDrop!  We don't give out 5 stars easily unless we really love something, but these GumDrop pacifiers are the best.  One thing to note - I wasn't sure what the difference was between the newborn vs. full-term GumDrop pacifier - newborn was what we received in the hospital on the package but it said full-term on the ones we ordered here on Amazon.  From what we can tell, we believe the only difference is the thickness/consistency of the silicone.  The newborn ones appear to be a little thinner/softer type of silicone and the full-term ones are a little thicker/sturdier perhaps since they chew harder especially now that there are teeth!  There is no difference in the length of the stem or the overall shape of the pacifier.  We purchased the natural scent as we thought that was safest and we just make sure to wash them often so they don't get the plastic type of smell pacifiers sometimes carry.  But next time we may try to order the vanilla scent just to see what the difference may be.    Pros:   - Love the nose cut-out because they can breathe easily without interference and it is made to conform to their face comfortable - not like the Soothie that takes up their whole face!- Hole for stem is easy for her to put her finger through when she wants to chew on something with some substance  - Medical-grade silicon -> dishwasher safe  - One piece of silicone is easy to clean and doesn't collect in hard-to-reach crevices  - Soft and pliable -> no nipple confusion when breastfeeding  - Firm enough that your little one can chew away but lightweight  - Hole that you can loop a pacifier strap through it to attach to their clothes  - Available in four colors: pink, purple, orange and blue    Cons: NONE!*  *One we received from the hospital recently cracked (after 7.5 months of use) as she liked to chew on all sides of them now that she can grab them herself and she was bending them backwards (against the way they are made to fit smoothly against their face).  I tried giving her one of the others we had until I could order some GumDrops and she put them in her mouth, immediately pulled them out and laid them on the ground all in a matter of two seconds.  That's why I think the full-term are helpful because it's a sturdier silicone likely better equipped for older babies/toddlers.    Just recently we saw [[ASIN:B004IOHN8Q The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Infant Pacifier, Pink/Purple]] are now sold at Target and they have the same shape and appear to be almost identical to these but these also are offered in one more color, green.  I did buy some just to see if they were different and I noticed the difference in the thickness of the silicone in these much clearer than the ones on Amazon.  The First Years 0-3 months version is softer/thinner/more pliable than the 3+ months version which is a thicker/sturdier silicone.  The best price is still on Amazon, but still a good back up if you're ever in a bind.
