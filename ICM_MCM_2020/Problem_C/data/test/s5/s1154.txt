I bought a Tescom hair dryer almost 10 years ago from a Japanese chain that is locally owned where I live, very similar to this one except without the extra styling attachment. That had been the best hair dryer I had owned, and the American market doesn't have any (nothing of the same quality at least) as the one I'd had. So after a good nearly 10 years, the Tescom retired itself and I needed a replacement. I did a search for the same brand and several Panasonics came up. Panasonic in Japan makes great quality products so after a little searching and looking through reviews I ordered this model - mainly because of the adjustable styling brush AND it was dual voltage (I'd hate to have to get a voltage converter for something that is everyday use). This hair dryer is way better than the one I'd had for so long and I love it! Great for styling my bangs and giving my layers a little bit of body and slight curl at the ends. I would highly recommend this product to ladies who hate having to try and style their hair with a traditional blow dryer and a round brush.
