As a pediatric speech-language pathologist specializing in feeding disorders  I love the gumdrop.  The shape makes it ideal for patients on binasal cannula oxygen and CPAP; other pacifiers must be cut (often leaving sharp edges) to fit around medical apparatus.  I have had numerous patients' parents call after discharge requesting more gumdrops as it is the only pacifier their children will take.  So glad to see them available on amazon.com.
