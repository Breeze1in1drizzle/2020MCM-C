This is an incredibly powerful hair dryer for the size.  For years I have run across this exact hair dryer at 5 star hotels all across the country & Caribbean.  I have really long, thick hair & always dreaded using the cheaply hotel dryers because they took FOREVER to dry my hair. This one worked like a charm time & time again.<br /><br />Finally, I looked it up & couldn't believe how inexpensive it was. I ordered 1 for my house & 2 for my beach house. Had them almost 2 years now & they still work great!!<br /><br />My only issue is that the retractable cord gets where it won't retract sometimes, but the dryer is still powerful & works like a charm!
