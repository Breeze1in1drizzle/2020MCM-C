My baby loves these. She chews on the sides when teething. Also, she didn't have any issue going to the new size. I just wish i could know when ordering exactly what the colors would be, Instead of yellow, mine came with green edges. I don't mind though. I also liked the fact that these are different than ones sold in the stores. There were several babies born in our church this year and alot of them had the same newborn paci's.
