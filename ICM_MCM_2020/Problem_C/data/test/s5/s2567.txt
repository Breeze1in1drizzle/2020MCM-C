It's 3am. It's been an hour since the baby ate last and you have finally slipped into REM sleep. Beautiful sleep... you start to dream and BAM! The baby lets out a cry and you look at the clock. Letting out a groan you roll out of bed and stumble to the baby. The baby is still asleep but that won't last long if you can't locate the pacifier. Thank goodness you thought to buy a MAM Night Glow pacifier. Instead blindly feeling around the bed... then crawling around the floor hoping you can find it in time... You spot the pacifier immediately, pop it into baby's mouth and he/she makes that classic Maggie Simpson sucking noise. Silently you tip-toe back to bed and hope it lasts...<br /><br />Bottom line: Even if it's been hours since the pacifier has been exposed to light, it still emits a decent glow so you can locate it in the darkest of rooms. I only buy the glow in the dark pacifiers now. Unlike many other pacifiers MAM pacifiers can be put in two ways.... there is no &#34;right side&#34; up. This makes giving it to baby in the middle of the night that much easier. I love MAM and will continue to buy these for my babies!
