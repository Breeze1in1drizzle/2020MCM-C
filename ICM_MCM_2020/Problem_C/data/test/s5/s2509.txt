I've ordered MAM pacifiers several times and have always been happy with the product. I ordered more because our pediatrician recommended keeping several in the crib so that he could find one himself in the middle of the night, instead of waking us at 4:00 am to find it. I ordered the Glow in the Dark nighttime and Air Silicone versions. I especially like these because he can wrap his little fingers around the edges without too much accuracy and can also attach easily to a pacifier clip should we (on occasion) need to take them on the go. I would also like to note that the design received was the same as that shown in the picture (a blue zig-zag design and lighter stars graphic).
