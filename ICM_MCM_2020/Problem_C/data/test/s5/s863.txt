I waited until I used the hair dryer for a couple months before writing a review.  I have medium length hair and dry my hair about 4 days a week.  So far this hair drying has held up very well.  It's light weight and is actually a little quieter than my previous Revlon hair dryer that died after 10 years of use.  I don't use the diffuser because it doesn't do a thing for my board straight hair.  For the money this is an excellent dryer.
