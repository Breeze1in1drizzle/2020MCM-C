I purchased this one after keeping an eye out for a compact wall-mounted unit for our small guest bathroom.  It fits in a tight space quite nicely.  Does all the things that a hair dryer is supposed to do.  Reasonably quiet and robust drying air flow.  A good purchase at a very reasonable price.  Would recommend for anybody looking for this type hair dryer.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000X2UCJO Jerdon First Class Wall Mount Hair Dryer, 1600 watts, 2 Speeds/Heat Settings, White]]
