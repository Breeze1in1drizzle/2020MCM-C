We bought TONS of Nuk pacifiers for our baby and they were fine...until one day when I picked her up at daycare, the woman told me she had the best nap she had ever had there (slept for hours for the first time). Ok this might be gross and unhygienic but our daughter picked up another baby's paci and immediately calmed down and went to sleep (it was a Mam). what! that night I ordered these on Amazon and we will never ever use another brand of Paci. She loves them. I have no idea what it was...but these things are awesome. Right around when we got her these she started sleeping through the night (I can't directly contribute it to these but I can't discount it either). I'm a little bummed because I have a pile of literally 20 Nuks that I am just going to end up throwing away but sleep is worth it as you other mommies know :-)
