When I decided to purchase this..my mind was made up..I was going professional.  The price for a professional hair dryer could be very expensive considering I am not a hairstylist; so I brought this..it was priced in the middle.  I totally love this Elchim!!! I have curly hair and I could straighten it or wear it curly with no frizz.  I would recommend this product.  It's worth every penny.
