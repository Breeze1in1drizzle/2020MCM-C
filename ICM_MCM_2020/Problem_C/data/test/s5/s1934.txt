My son seems to like this style pacifier the best so I went out and bought two more packages.  They come in pink & green or blue & green. (Buy them in the store though if you can find them.  I got mine at Target for $3.49/ two pack.)  I like that they are very easy to clean.  I will either run them through the dishwasher or in our microwave steam sterilizer to clean.  They do not come apart and it is nice to have a small handle to grab onto them or clip a pacifier tether onto it.  They do not wrap around my son's face like other brands and they have big air vents to keep from having too much moisture up against his face.
