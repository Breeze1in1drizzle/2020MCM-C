Works beautifully and fast.  Lots of heat choices.  Hot is hot with this dryer.  I had to wear a terry headband around my forehead, ears, neck because of the &#34;leakage&#34; of hot air, but otherwise, it dried my curly hair very quickly, almost as fast as at the salon.  Love the thin case and the way the power cord, bonnet and air hose store in the case.  I worried about where I'd store this in a small apartment, but it's no problem.
