I bought this for my wife because I became convinced she was going to go deaf eventually from her previous hairdryer, I found it deafening from down the hallway but she's running the thing for minutes a day right next to her ears :-)<br /><br />This one is remarkably quieter - still a noisy gadget, but what a difference.  Much lower decibels and a more pleasant, lower frequency sound as well.<br /><br />The jury seems to be out on whether ions do anything or not, but after a couple weeks' use she did remark that it worked faster and she thought her hair looked better too.
