bought these for my daughter because they were not only adorable but they are GREAT at night because they usually stayed on her chest when the paci fell out.  Even if it fell to the side of her, they are so easy to find in the middle of the night when you're half asleep!!!  also thought they would be great for her to hold onto when she gets a little older
