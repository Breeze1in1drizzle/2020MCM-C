we started introducing bottle to our baby when she was 8 weeks old. She didn't take Dr. brown. Pedietrician suggested Playtex Drop-In natural latch on, which has a flater and softer nipple. She still didn't like it. I kind of started worrying if we would have to try a million brands to figure out which she will take. I've heard about MAM before, so started with MAM. Lucky us! The first time she latched on, it was not perfect but at least she didn't resist or play with it. The 2nd time she finished 2 oz! Now she is 13 weeks, no problem with bottle feeding any more. Thank you MAM for such a great product!
