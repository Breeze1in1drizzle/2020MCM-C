Dry hair extremely quick and leave hair in a perfect condition.<br />It needs less about half time than other hair dryer.<br />And the hair is smooth without any damage.<br />It is an impressive product.<br /><br />Cons is the weight. It is heavier than other brands.<br />However I don't have to hold it for too long since it dries hair super quick, hence the weight is not too big an issue to me.
