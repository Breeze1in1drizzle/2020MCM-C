My husband put it together and got to use it twice. So far so good, but you do need to be careful so it won' tip over. It is a really quiet machine and the ticking of the clock is really not that bad. If I did not hear the ticking I would not know if it was on or not. I can have a conversation with the person sitting under it that's how quiet it is and it gets really hot. My husband is thinking of placing more weight on the feet so it would be more stable. For the amount of money I think it is worth it.
