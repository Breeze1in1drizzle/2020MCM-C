My microwave was rusting out badly and it is an undercabinet attached microwave.  I didn't want to have to buy a new one to fit in that small spot and I didn't want to have to remove the microwave to paint it.  So in a couple of hours, I cleaned the microwave (directions online), covered all surfaces from overspray, and used this paint.  Now I have a new microwave and I keep a clean sock filled with rice in it when it is not being used.  The rice absorbs the moisture so the microwave won't rust again.  I am very happy.
