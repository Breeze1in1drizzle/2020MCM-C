I have full size T3 for the home, and I wanted a compact T3 for travel (because no one wants to have a bad hair-day on vacation; think of the pictures!) I need a decent dryer to handle my long hair. Hotel dryers are always pretty cheap, and my old mini travel was useless. T3 travel dryer is pretty comparable to the full size. You still get fairly fast dry times, softer hair, no frizz, and more volume. The only difference between the Travel and Full size is that the Travel drying times are a bit longer. It also comes with a little travel pouch, as an added bonus.<br /><br />You can certainly get away with buying the travel dryer for home use to save money over the regular one (which normally runs $200, and you really have to wait out the sales). It works better than a typical semi-professional dryer in the same price range (works better than my old Tool Science dryer, which was about $60).<br /><br />My favorite thing about the T3s is that they can actually handle restyling my hair when it's already dry (none of my old dryers could ever do this; I had to spray water in my hair and re-dry).<br /><br />Another review mentioned the drier did not have a serial number on the nozzle. This was not my experience. My dryer had the sticker with the serial number under the nozzle (look for a clear label that says DANGER). I highly recommend registering your product on the T3 website. I had problem with my full size dryer (not this travel size one), and the T3 Co, honored their warranty and fixed it.
