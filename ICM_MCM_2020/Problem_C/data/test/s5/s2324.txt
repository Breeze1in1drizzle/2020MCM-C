These are great pacifiers. My baby prefers the shape of the Nuk pacifiers over other brands:  the exterior is curved down below the nose and the orthodontic shape of the silicone pacifier.  Plus, the sports theme is very cute.  I did buy these at a local retail store so I could choose a package that include a baseball + football pacifer.
