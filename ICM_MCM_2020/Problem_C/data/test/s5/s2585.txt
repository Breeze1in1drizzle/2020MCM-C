My baby loves these pacifiers. he rejected the pacifiers that were given in the hospital and that are attached to all the wubanubs (you know which one I'm talking about). He just spits them right out, or tongue thrusts them out. But he loves these and they are easy to keep in his mouth.  I love that they come in a little storage box. We keep one box in the pocket of our baby carrier (ergo) and one in the diaper bag.
