Love Love Love this hair dryer.  This is my 3rd one over the course of many years.  I not only use in my home but in my RV.  Great power and the size is just right .  Hangs on wall and that is a plus because it's at you fingertips when needed.  This one just purchased replace one I have had for 10 years........they last a good long while. Highly recommend!
