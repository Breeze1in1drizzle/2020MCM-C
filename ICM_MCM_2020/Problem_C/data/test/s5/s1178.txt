Hair gets dry fast! I have long hair, below my shoulders but above waist.  It takes me 35-40 minutes (I have fine textured hair).  The temperature never feels too hot but it does the job, even at its highest level; and there is barely any sound coming out of this hair dryer!  One can literally talk on the phone or what TV while under this dryer.  One of the pieces, the hinged hood, broke during shipping, but the company responded quickly and promised to ship it.  But I did not wait, I used super glue so that i could go ahead and start using it.  It works just fine!
