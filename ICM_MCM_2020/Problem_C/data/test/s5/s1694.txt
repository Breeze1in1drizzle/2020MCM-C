Exactly what we hoped for in every way.<br />After needing to retire our well-loved Advantium, we opted to replace it with a more-basic microwave.<br />After rewiring from 220 (what the Advantium required) to regular ol' 110, we bought this GE microwave-combo<br />and had it installed. What separates this unit from other combination models? Well, for one...<br />We can use the timer AND the microwave at the same time; Something we kind of took for granted<br />in having had the Advantium for so many years.No other microwave seems to have this stupidly-basic<br />feature, something we learned the hard way by initially purchasing a top-rated Sanyo unit.<br />(And they questioned US when we kvetched about the timer/use of microwave conflict, insisting we were<br />asking for too much; Right...)<br />Back to this GE: Stainless steel interior is wickedly-easy to clean, the 'beep' tone isn't obnoxious, and the heating<br />element cooks evenly.<br />Just perfect in all ways; Can't say more about it.<br />Thanks!
