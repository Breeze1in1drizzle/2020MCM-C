This dryer works really well, just like the ones in salons. It can get hot in there, but its the same hotness   you would experience in a salon. Heat can be controlled by how deep you stick your head in there. Cord does get   a little warm, but this doesn't seem to be any type of safety issue. This dryer makes it so that you can easily  watch tv or read a magazine while drying your hair. I use them for my dreadlocks and it works great!!
