Having recently broken my wrist and also having hand function issues, this is the perfect dryer for me. I also loved the price and it is supposed to be a high quality dryer that should last for years. So what else could you want? I have never used more than high and never use those cool shots or ionic type dryers. This fits my needs perfectly. Love it!
