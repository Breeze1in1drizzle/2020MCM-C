This is the 2nd time I bought this little hair dryer because I like it so much. My first one finally bit the dust after about 3 years. It's very small and lightweight--a plus for the suitcase, but still powerful enough to blow dry my hair fast. I have short hair, and this sweet little dryer is all I need to dry and style my hair--no need for a comb or brush. It's no frills--only 2 speeds--high and low. But it does exactly what I need it to, and it does it fast!
