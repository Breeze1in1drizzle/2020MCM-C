I bought this hair dryer because I wanted a cooler setting for drying my hair without holding down a cool setting and trying to manipulate the dryer on my hair. This dryer does an amazing job in drying my hair without the damage that hot air does to my hair. Cool air actually makes hair appear shiny and closes the follicles making the hair seem healthier.
