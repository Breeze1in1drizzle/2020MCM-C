Pirate stuff is awesome no matter what, when I saw this I really wanted one for my newborn son, and ordered it right away, then when it arrived I was surprised how big the skull was on the other side and relized that he would need to be 6+ months before he could hold the weight of this thing!! Either way I thought it was still adorable and can't wait to use it.
