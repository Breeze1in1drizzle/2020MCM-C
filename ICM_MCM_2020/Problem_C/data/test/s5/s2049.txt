My baby's ONLY pacifiers...  They actually STAY IN!!  Even when they are little.  And as they grow older, there is much more for them to grab onto.  Couldn't live without.  And I am sure that this will be my little one's lovie...  At almost 5 months she loves to hold onto it for comfort whether or not it is in her mouth.  Had to buy a second recently as a back up because don't ever want to be without...
