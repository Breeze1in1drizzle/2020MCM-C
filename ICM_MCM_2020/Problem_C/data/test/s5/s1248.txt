I got the leopard print and it's beautiful!!!<br />this model is a little bit heavier than the Babyliss TT tourmaline titanium (the white one), but it does dry the hair in HALF the time!!! I have long hair around the middle of my back and I dried it completely in 4m25s. With the Babyliss TT it would take about 8-9 minutes. Do this is completely worth it!!!!
