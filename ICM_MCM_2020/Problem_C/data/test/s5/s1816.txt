The little hole is the perfect size for your finger. My baby loves to suck on this pacifier, and it's been a godsend in getting him back to sleep after midnight breastfeedings when he still wants to suck but is no longer drawing any milk. We brought one home from the hospital, and I'm about to buy a bunch more. Don't pay attention to people who say they are choking hazards; if the pacifier is small enough that the entire thing fits into your child's mouth, it is too small for him. Buy a bigger size!
