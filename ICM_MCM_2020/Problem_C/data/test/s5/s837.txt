I had my old GE wall type hair dryer for 13 years.  Sadly it passed away.  I had the old metal bracket on the wall and thought &#34;if only I could get the same dryer to fit the old bracket.  I wasn't eager to start filling the holes and repainting the spot and maybe the whole bathroom if I couldn't match the wall color.<br />Yippee!  I ordered one that looked similar and attached over the old bracket.<br />The new dryer is perfect!
