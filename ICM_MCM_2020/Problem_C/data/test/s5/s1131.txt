I'm very picky with my blowdryers. It always seems like they're either too hot, not hot enough, or don't give enough pressure to mold my hair. This blowdryer suffers from NONE of those problems. On top of the high quality drying it delivers, it is also very comfortable to hold. Most blowdryers have hard plastic handles that can slip easily (especially after a shower) but this one has a nice rubber texture to it. I've been using my Mangroomer for a couple of months now and I am thoroughly satisfied with it. Highly recommended!
