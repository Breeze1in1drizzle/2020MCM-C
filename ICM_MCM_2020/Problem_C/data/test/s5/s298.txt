Tacks onto the wall very nicely.  It comes with double sided thick tape and places for screws.  I used the tape and haven't had any problems in over month.    I saw these in hotels all the time and loved the convenience.  Now I don't have to deal with dragging it out of the closet every morning.  It's right there hanging next to the mirror.    I found it to be plenty powerful, and not too hot.  The lower setting is good if you don't want to disturb someone who is sleeping.  The high setting is powerful and loud.
