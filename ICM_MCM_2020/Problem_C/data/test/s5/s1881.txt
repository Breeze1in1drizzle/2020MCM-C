We received the yellow duck wubbanub as a shower gift and I never even took it out of the box. After trying different pacifiers that left marks on Josiah's face, I figured I'd try the wubbanub, because it was the same pacifier they used in the hospital.<br />Josiah is 8 weeks old and he LOVES this paci! He uses it at naptime and bedtime, and loves to hold the little plushie duck as he goes to sleep, and the very lightly weighted head and feet of the duck helps hold the paci in place.<br />I posted pics of Josiah with his yellow duck, so you can see how easy it is for even a new baby to hold.<br />After receiving the duck as a gift, I then purchased the red dog and green frog.  I plan on buying these for future shower gifts!
