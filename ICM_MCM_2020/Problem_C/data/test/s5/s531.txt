I found it very hard to buy a blow dryer on line but after some research and talking with my hair stylist I decided to purchase the FHI Nano.  I couldn't be happier with this product.  The best feature is the three heat options.  This dryer really does leave your hair looking silky and healthy.  You definately will see a big difference compared to the cheaper dryers.  If you need to replace your dryer this is worth the money.
