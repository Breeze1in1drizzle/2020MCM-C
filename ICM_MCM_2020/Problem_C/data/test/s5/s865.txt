This is my second version of this hair dryer.  The first one I used for several years and it finally gave up the ghost.  I like the fact that it folds to a small size and it gets hot enough to actually style my hair.  I hope this one lasts as long as the first one.  I have had a couple of travel hair dryers, but this one is better by far.  One good feature is this one does not have such a loud, high pitched scream as most small hair dryers.  The cold air button is also a BIG plus, since I use that when styling my hair with a round brush.  Overall, this is a great product.
