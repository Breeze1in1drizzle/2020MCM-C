I was looking for a lightweight, high-power hair dryer with lots of features (high/low, warm/hot, cold shot) ... and this one surpassed expectations. It is very light and sleek, making it easy to manipulate and switch hands/sides of head. It is also very powerful without being overwhelming. It dries my thick head of hair faster than my previous 3 dryers did. I can't think of any criticism, except a curl diffuser attachment would have been nice.
