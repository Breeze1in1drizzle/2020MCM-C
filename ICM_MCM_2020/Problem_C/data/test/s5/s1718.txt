this is a fabulous microwave. It does both jobs of a regular microwave and a toaster oven. What more could you ask for. Presets are a bit off but it is pretty convenient to have. You can grill in this as well, though I haven't tried it yet.. I'll keep you posted. I would recommend this product to others.
