Our son loved his WubbaNub! He just recently gave up the pacifier, but up til now, he looked forward to going to bed each night so he could spend time with his WubbaNub. It helped him find his pacifier at night so we didn't have to go into his room and find it for him, and it works like a stuffed animal too, giving him comfort from the personality of the animal. If our second son, born recently, desires a pacifier as well, we'll be getting him a WubbaNub as well.
