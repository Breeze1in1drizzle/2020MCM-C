These pacifiers are great. The best part is that if my son drops it when sleeping, he won't get a mark on his face if he accidently sleeps on it. He also doesn't get that ring around his mouth from sucking to hard like other pacifiers.  Plus I like think its cute to see the little hole in his mouth when he sucks. It's also super easy to throw in the hot water to sterlize.
