These bottles are amazing. My baby was exclussively breastfed until 3 months, when I had to return to work. I was very worried because I have heard from other moms that their babies did not want to breastfeed after introducing bottlefeeding. We tried Avent and Nuk and he woudn't drink out of these. The MAM bottles have not caused nipple confussion. He is now 6 months old and he still breastfeeds when I am at home and bottlefeeds while I'm at work. The only issue we have had is that if you are not careful when assembling them, they may leak when warming up the bottle. Just take your time when putting the bottles together; make sure they are assembled tightly and correctly and this will not happen.
