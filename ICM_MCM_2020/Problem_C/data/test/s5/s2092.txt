I bought this product for my newborn grandson (who wasn't keen on his 'regular' pacifier), having seen my other grandchildren loving their Natursutten pacifier. The shape seems to suit the baby's mouth & helps soothe them almost instantly when they are fractious. I would recommend this product to others without hesitation.
