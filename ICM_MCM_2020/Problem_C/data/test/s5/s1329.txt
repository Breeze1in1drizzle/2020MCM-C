For just $7.99 & FREE Shipping (without even buying over $35.00) this is another very best buy, praise the Lord! Sturdy, powerful, and comes with 2 attachments (that I don't need), and the lowest price anywhere online (or anywhere I know of ) for this level of dryer/blower. It has two speeds with low and high heat, and a cool switch, which, like other ones i have tried  still blows some warm air, not the ambient temp.     These run off 120v AC,  which is needed for the heating element, though  I assume that like other ones  inside is a 12v DC blower motor. These likely do not cost much to make, but some can be very expensive. Why pay more?
