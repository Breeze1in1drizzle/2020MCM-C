We love this. One of our favorite parts of the kitchen remodel. Such a space-saver and it just IS cool. I read some negative reviews - all stemming from not have a revolving plate and might be damaged if someone pushes down on it? Well duh. I have a 5yo and 8yo - they know not to stand on/in the microwave. And it's 2015 - who needs a revolving plate? I use a microwave for quick stuff, not rotisserie chicken and what-not. We are super-pleased with this microwave.
