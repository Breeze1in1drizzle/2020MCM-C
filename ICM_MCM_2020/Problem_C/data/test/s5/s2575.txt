MAM pacifiers are the best.  My son only likes MAM.  He spits out other brands like Nuk and Philips Avente Soothies.  These glow in the dark ones are perfect for bed time.  We have been using two for a few months now and they still glow in the dark.  You can recharge them by putting them under a bright light before bed.  No more looking for pacifiers in the dark.<br /><br />All MAM products are much cheaper at Target.
