I purchased this hairdrier after reading the reviews from Consumer Reports - rated in the top 2.  I tried to find locally, but couldn't find any from this manufacturer...but was tired of NOISY, HEAVY hairdriers!  This one works great, has multiple temperature settings and is quiet and light - with an extra long cord to boot.  It is also very attractively styled.  No regrets.
