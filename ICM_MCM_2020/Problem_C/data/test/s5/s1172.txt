Today,( 3/14/14) that I used my hair dyer, I have to say I just love it. My hair is naturally curly but takes so, long too dry. I have a hand held dyer with the diffueser attchatment an it makes my hair puffy.  I started to look for this type of hair dyer that was quick an sufficient an when looking they were really expensive as well as shipping and handling but when I compared on amazon your company caught my eye because on the head of the dyer was elongated and there was zero shipping so, all I paid was 104.00 and other companies wanted more money and  shipping and handling. I also colored my hair an I use a heating cap an it does not color my head completely so, this will make for a better job on my color. Thank you so so so so so much......
