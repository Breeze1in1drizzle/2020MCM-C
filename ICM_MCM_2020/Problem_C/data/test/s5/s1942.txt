Some babies can be so fussy about pacifiers, but my baby never refused one of these.  She uses Playtex pacifiers everyday.<br /><br />At daycare she has this one with a handle because they hang them up on a little hook when she's not napping.<br />At night I kind of prefer the ones without the handle...cuz she can tend to play around with it, dangle it out of her crib, etc.<br /><br />Nice to have both options in my opinion, and plus you'll need at least 4 in rotation...there's always one missing, in the other room, hiding underneath the crib, in the carseat, etc.
