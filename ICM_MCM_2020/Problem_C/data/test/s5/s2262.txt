these are great. my newborn can keep this paci in his mouth better than soothies. the nipple is the same shape as the soothie which was important since i'm nursing. we have had zero nipple confusion. our lactation consultant also recommended using a paci (soothies or gumdrops only to prevent confusion) saying they've actually been recommended to prevent sids...SOLD.
