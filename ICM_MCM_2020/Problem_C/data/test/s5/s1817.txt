The Blue Super Soothie Pacifier looks like the ordinary green ones but is made of thicker material.  It works wonderfully for older children.  My 19 mos old son is teething and chews on his hands constantly.  He won't use teething toys but he chews the edge of the pacifier.  He could bite through the green ones but the blue one is thick enough he cannot bite through.
