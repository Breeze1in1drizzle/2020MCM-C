I had this blow dryer a few years ago it lasted 6 yrs. I have since gone through the chi which broke in 6 months & solano which has completely destroyed my hair....only because I couldn't remember the name of my old dryer. It was just recently while asking a friend if she knew of a good blower that i was reconnected with the twin turbo. It is by far the best blow dryer I have ever had!!
