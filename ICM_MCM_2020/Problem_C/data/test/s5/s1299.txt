I have been very happy with this hair dryer. My daughters and I have all tested it, and we've had consistently good results. We have long, medium, and short hairstyles between us. We all have straight, fine hair and a lot of it. Our hair tends to get flat, not frizzy.<br /><br />The dryer does work faster than other dryers we've had, and it is quieter. Blowouts result in shinier, smoother hair than before. I like the multiple settings, although there is a learning curve, and I found myself pushing the wrong switches at first. The cold shot of air is a real help in styling, especially for short hair styles. We've used the concentrator, and it fits securely and stays on.<br /><br />I thought the dryer was a bit heavy, but my kids (12 and 14) never mentioned the weight. It's been hard to get them to blow dry their hair, but they wanted to use this dryer -- a big plus to me, I admit. (I'd be a stylist if I wanted to give someone a blowout, but I'm not and I don't.) It's a full-sized blow dryer and comes with loop so you can hang it if you wish. I wasn't sure where I wanted to store the dryer, so I temporarily rested in inside the strong box it comes in and tucked the box in my linen closet between a stack of towels and the wall. It's worked so well that I'm still using it, but it's a nice looking dryer, and I would display it if my bathroom were larger and had more wall space.
