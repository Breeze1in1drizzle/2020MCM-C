I waited 6 mos to write this review because I wanted to be sure it atleast lasted that long. This thing is perfect for home use. I use it on myself and my daughter. roller sets come out perfect. twistouts dry in half the time wash and go's have less shrinkage because the gel cast sets faster. I'm so glad i ordered this product. It is top heavy when you try and roll it I support the bottom and top as I push but it mainly stays in one spot. The bell can be a bit startling but mainly because you tune out the sound of the dryer so when the timer goes off you've forgotten what you were doing. i dont find it necessary to crank the heat all the way up, at mid range my hair is dry in about 40min. In Short... I love this dryer and if anything happened to it I would gladly purchase again. I ordered my dryer the week of Christmas it was on my doorstep the next day
