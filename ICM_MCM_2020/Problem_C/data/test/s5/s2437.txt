Amazing baby item. Our 7-month-old loves it and smiles at his froggy each time he gets into his car seat! He can fully entertain himself swapping the pacifiers back and forth, cooing and laughing. It's wonderful for the car when I cannot be back there with him. It's the handiest product we have ever purchased in five kids!
