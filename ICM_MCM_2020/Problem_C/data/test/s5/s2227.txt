If your baby started using one of these pacifiers as a newborn, it can be hard to switch over to other pacifiers once they have learned a preference.  This was the case in my baby.  She only liked her pacifier from the hospital.  I was happy to find the same hospital recommended brand online.  The 2 pack gives you a spare for the diaper bag which is really convenient.
