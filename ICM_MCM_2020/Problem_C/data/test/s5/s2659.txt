These are great pacifiers. We tried several types/brands before these and my daughter likes these the best by far.<br /><br />Advantages over others:<br />I really wanted to use the avent soothies but they just wouldn't stay in my daughters mouth. They bumped her nose and in general just looked too large and slightly uncomfortable.<br /><br />I also tried other nuk pacifiers. What I liked about them was the shape. The heart shaped shield seemed to fit better and just looked more comfortable. The shape of the pacifier nipple was shorter and the shape seemed easier and more enjoyable for my daughter to keep in her mouth. She loved it but it wasn't my favorite because it couldn't be sterilized and water would get trapped in the nipple. It just didn't seem as hygienic as I would have liked.<br /><br />Then I found these. The orthostar pacifiers are the best. They are all one silicone piece, similar to the avent pacifiers. They can be sterilized and there is no way for water to get trapped anywhere. They have the great shape that is more comfortable for my daughter's face and the nipple is just the right size and shape to make it easy for her to keep it in her mouth. This is by far mommy and baby's favorite pacifier!
