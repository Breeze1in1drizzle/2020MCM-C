I love this hair dryer!  I asked my hairdresser how he achieved such silkiness and shine in my hair, when I, using  the same products at home, couldn't.  He told me the blow dryer is the key.  He told me to buy from Amazon for best price, and to make sure I chose the Featherweight T3 by  Bespoke Labs.  It is delicate; I keep it in the box and put it away as soon as I'm done, which is 10-12 minutes.  If it is dropped, the tourmaline technology can be damaged and will not work.  It is definitely worth the extra care it requires; it dries my hair FAST and leaves it shiny, sealed and beautiful!
