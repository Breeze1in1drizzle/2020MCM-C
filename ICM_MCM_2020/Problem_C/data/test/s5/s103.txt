I've tried the more expensive ones out there, including the Gold n' Hot (on  wheels & the bonnet dryer).  My hair never got dry in the back and in the crown area when using the Gold n' Hot dryers.  For years I used the Conair HH320LB Pro Styler Bonnet Dryer, and my hair dried very quickly.  When mine finally conked out after about 10 years of use, I went to Walmart to purchase a new one; and to my surprise, they no longer carried them.  I went to Sally Beauty Supply, Target, and other Beauty Supply Stores...no success.  Finally, I thought &#34;Amazon--bet I can find it there.&#34;  Sure enough, there it was!  I ordered it immediately!  I love the fact that this dryer has the option to open and close the vent on the top of the hood which is where other dryers lack.  I keep the vent closed for fast drying.  I am a licensed Cosmetologist who uses the commercial/industrial dryers at that salon, but at home, I use my Conair...works just as good!  Thanks Conair and Amazon!  Never stop making this product!...
