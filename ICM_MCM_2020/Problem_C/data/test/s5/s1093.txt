If you have hair that takes FOREVER to dry, this is the hair dryer for you.  It not only dries your hair, but leaves it soft and shiny. I have personally gone through about 15 different hair dryers to find the perfect one.  I discovered the Remington Jet Dry Turbo about 10 or 15 years ago (it used to come in bluish/purple). During this time, I've often looked for other models just to see if I could find something better, and there just isn't anything.  Many times, you'll find me using two hair dryers at the same time (which often causes the bathroom circuit to overload). I used stylist models that cost around $150 (Bespoke, Rusk Speed Freak, etc.) to Consumer Reports Best Hair Dryer - which I think the people who are reviewing them don't have lots of hair... because nothing holds a candle to this model.<br /><br />They also have a compact one that I keep in my gym bag.  It's not as good, but will do in a pinch.
