My almost-three year old daughter has slept with this cute bear since the day she was born!  It is perfect!  The volume can be adjusted, it shuts off automatically after 40 minutes, and it fits snugly to the side of the crib with a velcro strap so that it cannot possibly be removed by infants.  Now that she's a big kid in a big kid bed, she still falls asleep to the soothing sounds, but she also likes to carry the bear around and play with him.  The heartbeat sound the bear makes sounds just like what you hear through the Doppler at the OB's office!  Our little boy is due in 3-1/2 weeks, and we have a bear on the way for him, too!
