After purchasing probably 30 or 40 pacifiers for my 2 month old son so his babysitter wouldn't go insane, we found the Gerber soft center rounded pacifier was all he would take - mind you this was the larger older version. Then Gerber mindlessly 'revamped' the soft center to what it is today. The customer service rep said that 'Gerber didn't think babies would notice the change' - well, he did. He sucked on the same two pacifiers until I found the Natursutten - a year later. Although they are exceedingly more expensive, I purchased five and retired the Gerber. My son barely noticed the change, even though the base is a little wider (the part where his lips meet together). Thanks again. I would recommend this to anyone in the same situation; just try one and see if your little one will take it, it's worth the ten bucks.
