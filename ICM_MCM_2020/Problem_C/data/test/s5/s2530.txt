We have tried every other design of pacifier out there and our son just seems to like these the most bar none. They are designed well and just LOOK like they would be more comfortable than the others... The little ridge vent in the design does work also to reduce suction.. You just have to make sure to rinse it extra well as formula and food when they get a bit older will get in the ridge... It rinses right off with an extra second, but just calling attention to it... The stages (0-3mo,3-6mo,6-12mo) seem to be about right...
