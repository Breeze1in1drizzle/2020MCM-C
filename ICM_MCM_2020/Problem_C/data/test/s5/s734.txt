Just received it; yesterday; delivered on time, no problem.  It's so cute and improbable, like a Barbie-doll toy hairdryer in very pink plastic, just like its picture online in its box, complete with miniature pink plastic diffuser & concentrator. But it works as well as a larger hairdryer, certainly far, far better than a hotel wall dryer, and better than some full-sized ones, too. And it is extremely light, not tiring on the arms. The diffuser successfully brought out waves in my hair; the concentrator straightened my bangs.  I bought it to fit in my carry-on luggage, which it does nicely. What's not to like?
