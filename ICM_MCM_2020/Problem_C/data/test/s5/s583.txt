I read the reviews on this product from other customers before I purchased this dryer.  I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer! I have owned several hairdryers over the years and have even been known to burn up a few...  This dryer gets my thick hair completely dry and frizz-free in under 3 minutes.  I use product and a round brush and have been very pleased with this dryer.  It is quiet and doesn't get too hot.  I love the adjustable heat and speed settings.  I also use the concentrator attachment to channel the air.  I was unable to find this product at any local retailers (Walmart and Target are the two I checked) and i think it is better than the Conair Infinity X pro model.  If you need a dryer that gets your hair dry quickly and with minimal frizz, this is the one for you.
