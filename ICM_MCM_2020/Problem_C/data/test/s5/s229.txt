This is a great hairdryer. I have a full sized one for home and it dries my hair in less than 2 minutes and I have long hair. It leaves hair smooth and silky and has not damaged it at all. I bought this one to put in my gym bag and I was worried that it wouldn't work as well as the full sized version. I highly recommend this hair dryer!
