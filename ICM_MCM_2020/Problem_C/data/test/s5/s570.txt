This hair dryer performs as expected.  I have dry/damaged hair due to chemo 2 years ago.  I have never owned a hair dryer and thought that maybe blow drying my hair with a diffuser to increase wave/curl would make it look better but it didn't.  However this is not due to the hair dryer.  The hair dryer is light, was very easy to operate and try different hair styles with especially since it includes both a diffuser and a concentrator. I tried at least 10 different hair styles with this thing and found it super easy to adjust and operate.  Feature I love the most: adjustable heat setting.  I use the warm instead of hot and I can put the fan on low or high depending on how fast I want it.  Great dryer for the price but also for all of the features.
