This hair dryer does a wonderful job.  My hair comes out shiny and, with the diffuser that is included, I can maintain the curls and waves that are natural to my hair.  The nozzle can be set for precision when drying and there is a cool shot button in case the air feels too hot.  Three temperature settings make this dryer versatile and useful for wet or damp hair.  There is also a quick-dry nozzle attachment that disperses air throughout the head and makes drying very quick.  I would only recommend this if you are in a  rush because I found my hair duller looking when I used this attachment.  However, there are days when a quick dry comes in very handy.  The hair dryer's description says that it utilizes ions in the air to maintain moisture in your hair.  Whatever method it uses, it really works and is the nicest dryer I've ever had.
