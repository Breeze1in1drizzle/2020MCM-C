My old Conair died so I read all the reviews and decided on this hairdryer.  Very satisfied.  The weight is good, the attachments are fine, and the price was right!  You don't need anything better.  I really like the ability to open the cover to get to the mesh filter to clean it and the 3 heat settings and 3 blower settings. A winner!
