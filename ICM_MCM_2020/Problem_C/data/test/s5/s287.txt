I looked at this little dryer for one criterion that was my exclusive priority - I wanted a small handheld dryer that would not scare my pet cockatiel bird when I dry him after his shower in the winter! Needless to say, its color, size, sound and portability mattered. I chose this and couldn't be happier. He loves it too. The heat of both settings is ideal, it worked well for my hair too. The fact that it is dual voltage was not as important to me, although we travel to Europe a lot, but I can use the dryers in the hotel itself. It does sound a little louder than I had thought after reading reviews that it was quiet. The other issue is that the slider switch is a little difficult to operate and tends to slide all the way from end to end. It is difficult to move to the off position in the center.
