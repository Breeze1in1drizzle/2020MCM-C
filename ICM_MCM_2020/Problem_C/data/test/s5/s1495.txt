We were reluctant to spend so much on a microwave as we are not big microwave users but we absolutely love this and are glad we splurged. It defrosts without cooking, won't burn popcorn, can soften butter without melting, and of course looks amazing. Its easy to clean and was pretty easy to install.  If I had to come up with a shortfall there is a height limit so forget tall items like those rice express packages.  Still worth it and would still recommend it.
