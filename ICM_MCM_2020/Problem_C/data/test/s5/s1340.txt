I absolutely love this dryer! I was a bit apprehensive at first because of the price tag but it's well worth the money. I have curly, color treated hair and I definitely noticed the difference using this hair dryer verses my old one. My hair feels healthy, smoother...as if I just came back from the salon! Great product!
