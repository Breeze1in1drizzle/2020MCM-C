We love these pacifiers. They are so much softer then the regular silicone pacifiers. Even if you don't get these for health reasons get them because they are much softer and gummier for the baby. We have used them since our boy was born. Even though he is breastfed, we did not have any issues with nipple confusion. He took the pacifier when he was not hungry. When he was hungry he didn't want it. They do have to be replaced once they become sticky. But for sanitary reasons it's best to replace any kind of pacifer after about 2-3 months.
