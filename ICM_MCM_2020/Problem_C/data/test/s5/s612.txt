I wasn't expecting too much from the price but I definitely got my money's worth. I had an old dryer and this was much lighter and more quiet. It also has dried my hair faster, even on the low heat setting. Love the rubberized exterior which makes handling easier. Great purchase and would recommend it to a friend.
