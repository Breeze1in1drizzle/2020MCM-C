These are AMAZING.  I love so many things about these pacifiers...First, they're all natural and BPA free.  They're also one solid piece.  There's no soapy water getting stuck inside the pacifier.  These are also GREAT for teething.  My son will take the pacifier out of his mouth throughout the night, gum and chew all over the pacifier and he never makes a peep.  They're extremely soothing.  They are bouncy, though!  We've gone through many because we lose them!  Save yourself the hassle of using other, hard plastic, pacifiers...just buy these!!!!  They're AMAZING.
