THIS DRYER IS THE BEST I've used for my very curly hair. I DRY MY HAIR SECTION AT A TIME BY HOLDING THE DRYER CLOSE TO THE SCALP, AND SQUISHING THE HAIR INTO THE DIFFUSER. AFTER ABOUT 6 minutes my hair is completely dry. THEN I MASSAGE MY SCALP BUT I NEVER PUT MY HANDS THROUGH THE ENDS. IT IS CALLED THE PIXIE METHOD OF DRYING. I NEVER HAVE A BAD HAIR DAY ANYMORE.
