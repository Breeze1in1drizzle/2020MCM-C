I am so happy with this purchase!! It works absolutely great.  I have very thick hair with natural curls.  Normally it takes me about 20 to 30 minutes to blow dry my hair and then I have to go over it with the flat iron to get it completely straight.  It took me ten minutes tops when using this blow dryer and it was perfect when I was done.  Not only was it straight but I was able to style it as well.  I have to say I'm shocked!!! and happy!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who blow dries there hair straight.
