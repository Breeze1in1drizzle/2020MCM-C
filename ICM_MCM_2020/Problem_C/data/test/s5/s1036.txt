This is the 2nd one I've bought and the first from Amazon.  I loved the first one and had it for many years.  I paid less with amazon for this one and even though the first one hadn't stopped working it started to smell hot and I didn't want to take a chance.  I will continue to purchase this product as long as it's available.  My hair is long and it takes no time at all to dry and looks great.
