My daughter loves these pacifiers.  She won't use a regular one and we have several.  They are small enough for her to cuddle and I don't worry about the animal smothering her face.  It's safe for her to sleep with and easy for her to reach and keep in her mouth.  They wash easily and air dry in less than a day.
