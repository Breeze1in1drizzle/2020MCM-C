This dryer definitely lives up to its claims.  As an African American who has natural hair, I was looking for a product that would not dry-out my hair.  The technology of this dryer not only dries my hair quickly, but also leaves it hydrated with lots of moisture.  I use this for my daughter's hair as well, who has thick, coarse hair.  This dryer also provides moisture and helps with the manageability of her hair. I strongly recommend this product.
