I bought this wall-mounted dryer to free-up some space in the kids bathroom, and it works great. The nightlight is nice and bright and the dryer isn't too loud. The bracket mounted easily once I pounded the raised Ground screw terminal flat. The bracket won't lay flat against the wall with the raised Ground screw terminal on the bracket. The cord hook on the dryer mounted easily and works wonderfully. I've only had it a couple of weeks, but everyone in the family really likes it.
