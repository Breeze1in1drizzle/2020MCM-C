We love this paci! it's not thick and has a very nice design. It's surely different than the other ones available on the market. It's worth the price, because it doesn't suck the air around his mouth.  The only con it has, is it retains water whenever i sterlize it so you need to make sure to remove it before you give it back to your LO.
