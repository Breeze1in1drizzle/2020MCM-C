These pacifiers are so much fun!  My 18 month old loves looking at himself in the mirror while he has them in his mouth.  The pacifiers are really great quality.  The mustaches are attached securely and I have no worries of them pulling out or breaking.  The plastic appears to be of high quality and durable. Very happy with them!
