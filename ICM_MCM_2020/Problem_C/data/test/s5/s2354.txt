These are my (and my baby's) favorite pacifiers. I love them because they are natural rubber, made of one piece (so no hidden moisture/mold/bacteria issues) and have the lowered curve to go below the nose. The handle is also super easy for my baby to hold and bends easily in case she falls asleep with it and rolls to the side. It doesn't poke her in the face like others I've used. We also have the Ummy and while it's similar I don't like how big the base is...it covers too much of my baby's face for my comfort, despite the holes in it. It's also harder to figure out which way is 'up' when it's dark and I'm trying to quickly put the pacifier in so she can fall back asleep...having the dipped curve in the base makes it to much easier. Since the whole thing is rubber my now teething baby likes to gum the entire thing when she's not using it for its intended purpose. It's kind of funny to watch.  I was at Whole Foods the other day and saw the Eco Piggy, which I almost bought to try but didn't based on the reviews of the bulb part being huge. So I took it out to look at it and sure enough, it's massive! Unless you have a mammoth sized baby I'd skip that one. We're both happy with the Natursutten so I'm sticking to this one.  For those who have complained about the rubber smell/taste...just wash and sterilize it a couple of times and that goes away.
