Nicu pacifier she was given..funny thing is that u cant find these orange ones anywhere in stores. I bought all the other gumdrop colors, but she would not take them. I discovered the silicone was harder on the other gum drop pacifiers. I really paniced because I lookes everywhere for these orange ones and couldnt find them so I was very happy I found on amazon, now that I am down to my last one.  These are great and she loves the softer silicone..so, if your baby is pacifier specific, dont waste your money on all the other colors like I did, if baby was given and uses the orange, purchase the orange because there is a difference.
