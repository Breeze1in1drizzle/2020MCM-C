When I was prego I bought EVERY kind of ortho pacifiers for my soon to be baby boy. Little did I know that the hospital would stick a binkie in my baby's mouth as soon as he came out to the world.<br /><br />At first (my son's a preemie) they had to cut a portion of the paci so it didn't block his airway - this thing was almost 1/2 the size of his head. I tried switching him to other pacis, useless, either he couldn't grip it, or he'd spit it out.<br /><br />We didn't have any problems (like other parents) with him latching to the paci, only to breastfeed - but if you do have problems - try tickling/stroking their chin/jawline. It made my kiddo open up to feed, but with this paci, i think he could smell it a mile away.<br /><br />I can TOTALLY see why he'd like this, the nipple is shaped like a real nipple. It's easy for them to use and get full suction/grip on it.<br /><br />It comes in a variety of colors, but for some reason, the blue ones were way harder/thicker than the green ones. My son won't use any of them other than the green ones. There's also a paci holder - it's really cute, it turns the paci into a smiley face and it snaps on to a penguin or a flower. Super adorable.<br /><br />What I Don't like:<br />After we left the hospital - (we only snagged 3 of these pacis) - they were hard to find. Every chain/grocery store were sold out, and what we did find, we bought all of. As soon as we lost one or couldn't give one to my son when he needed it, the world literally would end. This was a peace offering to calm a very tyrannical baby. So i'm glad that Amazon carries it. We no longer have to keep track of pacis like our car keys and wallet. PHEW!<br /><br />Soothie also makes bottles. If your baby has a hard time drinking out of them (or just wouldn't latch (like my son did - avent, maam, medela, gerber, nuk) then get their bottles. Same nipple shape and comes in 2 different sizes.<br /><br />TEETH:<br />My son is almost 2 now and I was scared that because these were ortho pacis, that he'd have buck teeth or just out of line. I'm wrong. Kid has straight teeth. He still uses his paci in the morning and to fall asleep.f line. I'm wrong. Kid has straight teeth. He still uses his paci in the morning and to fall asleep.
