Purchased this for during my recovery from shoulder surgery.  We used the anchors and screws to permanently attach this to the wall.  Now after recovery, I still use this when I want a great looking salon style blow-out of my long hair.  I wish I had purchased this years ago, as it makes styling my below shoulder length hair super easy.
