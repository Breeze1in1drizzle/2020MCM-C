My little granddaughter used these from the start with no hesitation. At 6lbs 8ounces the small was perfect for her. We opted for the round and since she is a nursing baby we wanted to reduce nipple variations. I would recommend these, we were very attracted to the fact that there aren't any grooves were bacteria could live and grow. Also the fact that it is a natural product, rubber from a rubber tree.
