This hair dryer is much more quiet than my previous hairdryer, which was an adjustable ionic hairdryer.  It has this interesting grippy material around the outside which is very attractive and comfortable to hold.  It is lightweight and has three temperature and three speed settings. I don't think it gets super hot, which is good for me since I have fine hair and do not wish to dry it out.  My hair was incredibly soft after using this dryer.
