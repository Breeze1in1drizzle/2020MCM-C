Don't understand everyone's negative reviews about this dryer.  It dries my hair in half the time my old dryer took, it is no louder than any other blow dryer I've ever used, the controls are not difficult to use at all (you just push them upwards, for heavens sake!), and the retractable cord retracts exactly as it should.  The best thing is, even with all the positive things about the dryer, it didn't cost an arm and a leg like some I looked at.  &#34;Sticker&#34; shock indeed.  I love it!
