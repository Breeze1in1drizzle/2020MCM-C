I purchased this hair dryer because it was dual voltage, and I wished to use it in both the United Kingdom and France.  It has an American plug, but with a convertor for each country it worked wonderfully!  I could not be happier with this purchase.  Turns out we went to Italy too, and with the same French convertor, the dryer worked in Italy too.
