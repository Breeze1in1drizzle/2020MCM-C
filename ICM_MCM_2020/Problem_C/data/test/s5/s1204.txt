I was previously using a compact hair dryer that did more damage to my hair.  With the included nozzles, the adjustable temperature and adjustable air power, my hair is smoother and dries a lot quicker than before.  The cold air button is also a plus if you're round brushing your hair.  The non-slip coating on the dryer makes holding the device very comfortable.  HSI is powerful and works wonderfully.  Love it.
