I love this hairdryer, but for some people, they may not be completely ecstatic with the settings of this hairdryer.  WIth this hairdryer, you cannot really control the temperature of the air, only how intense the air flows from the dryer.  The only way to change the temperature of the air is to press the blue button on the hair dryer to make the air cooler.  Other than that side note, I love the color of the hairdryer and how quickly it dries my hair (my hair is long and it takes about 15 minutes to blow dry my hair).
