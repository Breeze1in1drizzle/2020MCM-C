As soon as my 5 month old daughter sat down with her PullyPal, she immediately knew to reach and grab for her passy. This actually taught her how to put her passy in her mouth. This not only allows her to choose which passy she wants, but also keeps them clean. Thank you for creating PullyPalz and teaching my daughter to retrieve her own passy. This is an excellent developmental teaching tool for all babies! #verydurable #cutetolookat #finemotordevelopment #handeyecoordination #amusthave
