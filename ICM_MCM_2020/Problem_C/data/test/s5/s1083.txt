I have a coworker who whenever she comes in with blown straight hair, it looks like she got it professionally done. I was looking to upgrade my blow dryer, and this was her recommendation.<br /><br />At first I was skeptical because it's kind of expensive, but then I bit the bullet and got it. I LOVE it.<br /><br />I have very curly, fine hair, and a lot of it, prone to frizz. It used to take me close to an hour and a half to blow dry my hair, then smooth over it with a flat iron.<br /><br />This blower dryer cuts my total hair-doing time in half! And I just touch up with a straightener on low heat (around my face, the top/back of my head). I use one of the concentrator attachments that comes with it (I believe the middle one).<br /><br />Also, I didn't touch up with a straightener for a few days, and my blow out really lasted!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone with hard-to-manage hair who wants a sleek and bouncy blow out.
