Even though heavier than my other travel dryer, this one worked well on my last trip. I like the ion technology, it does seem to eliminate a lot of the frizzies. I also like that it has THREE settings for blowing. Since my hair is fine, the lower setting is perfect for the round brush. The retractable cord made is easy to travel with.
