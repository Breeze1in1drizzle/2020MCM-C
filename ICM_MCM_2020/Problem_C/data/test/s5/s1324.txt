Can't beat the $10 price! I was looking for a new hair dryer, and this was one of the 3 choices I had. The other one was also Remington ($30), and the third was from another brand for around $60. I'm not a fan of yellow color, so this was one thing keeping me from getting this hair dryer (when I was looking at it, it cost around $20). However, next day the price went to $10, and I didn't have to think much as the specifications were exactly as what I was looking for. After trying the hair dryer, I can only say the best things - it works perfectly!
