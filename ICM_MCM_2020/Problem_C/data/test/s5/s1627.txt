I love this microwave. Small is what I needed but, wow what great extra features and it is beautiful. I am beyond happy! Yes it is small but, that is what I needed and what I am used to. I can't get my largest dinner plate in but, I can get my smaller ones in. I love how the back is rounded. I had a Sharp Half Pint that finally died after 24 yrs. This has way more features than the Sharp. I have very little counter space so, thank goodness I found this. Yes, it is pricey but, well worth the money to me. UPDATE &#62;&#62;&#62;I  purchased it 12/20/14 and it died April 3rd/2015. Whirlpool has been  very nice and will be sending a replacement.
