I have straight thick hair and my old hair dryers would leave it frizzy until I slept on it. However when I tried it with this blowdryer, even at the fast dry attachment, it was smooth and sleek.<br /><br />Now that I have a digital perm, I can use the diffuser. I put half of my hair twisted, sectioned into thirds and put it on the diffuser! It works wonderful so far. I'm so happy with this blow dryer. Worth the price. First expensive blow dryer I have owned. Now I can have nice waves.
