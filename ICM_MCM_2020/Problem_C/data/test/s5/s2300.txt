Great pacifier for my 3 year old. He is autistic and will not sleep without a pacifier. These are the only ones he hasn't been able to chew through. I do replace them every 2 months and I check them daily for any signs of rips or holes. They are soft but strong and I like that they are made of natural rubber.
