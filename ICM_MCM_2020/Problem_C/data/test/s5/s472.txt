Lightweight and super fast. With a vented roll brush, this leaves my hair looking sleek and healthy in record time. I can't remember the last time that I left the house with a completely dry head of hair...it used to take way too long to dry. Not anymore! I also like the little bling added to the handle of this special edition (SE) model. Worth every penny.
