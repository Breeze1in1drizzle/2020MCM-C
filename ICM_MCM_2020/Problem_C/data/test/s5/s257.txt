I love this hairdryer. At home, I use a CHI that I have had for about ten years. It still works perfectly but it is a beast. I was tired of using crummy hotel dryers and even the hand dryers at the gym so I started looking for a compact model and this really fits the bill at a great price. Keeps my hair as smooth as my pricey CHI and has a retractable cord plus a folding handle.
