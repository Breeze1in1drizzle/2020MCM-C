Decided to buy this hairdryer based on what my hair stylist said. I always wondered why it seems faster to dry my hair at the salon than at home. She said something about ionic hairdryers that not only speed up the drying time, but takes away unwanted frizzy hair. She said to buy a ceramic brush as well to help with drying and to prevent frizzy hair. After purchasing this hairdryer and the right brush, I am able to dry my hair in 5 minutes as opposed to 15 minutes with a hairdryer bought at like CVS or Rite Aid. I have really thick, medium length hair. Where I live where it gets humid from time to time, my hair does get frizzy. After buying this hairdryer, time and frizz were no longer an issue. My husband even commented on how fast I have been able to dry my hair. I figured if he noticed, then I believe I made the right purchase. This hair dryer is a &#34;game changer&#34;. Definitely, helped me get ready for my day a lot faster.
