I've been using this dryer for a couple weeks and I feel good about my purchase. I'm not seeing dramatic frizz reduction or anything but it does seem to have helped  a bit with my flyaway prone hair. I can definitely say that it is faster than my old dryer, and I'm amazed at how quiet it is!  I wish it was a bit smaller as it is sort of hard to store but other than that I am very happy.
