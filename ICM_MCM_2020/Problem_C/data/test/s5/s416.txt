Bought this model a few years ago and I really like it because the high setting speed is just right for styling your hair...some other dryers I have blow too fast on the high setting.  This model's high setting is a good speed and allows you to dry your hair without it blowing all over the place.  Also it is light and well balanced so holding it while drying is very comfortable.  I recently bought 2 more in case the manufacturer decides to stop production.
