I bought this dryer after much debate over its price about a month ago.  I had decided the price was worthwhile given how much more expensive it is at regular stores in the mall compared to Amazon.  Although it is still on the pricey side, I feel this was an excellent investment.<br /><br />I have fairly long hair that I blowdry every morning, and this dryer really does speed up that process.  It's true that the dryer doesn't seem to blow with much force, or with much heat, but it actually dries my hair much faster than any of my old brands (conair, vidal sassoon) with less noise and without me working up a sweat.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it indeed makes your hair smoother or shinier... I have straight hair as is.  But coworkers and friends have been commenting a lot lately on how healthy my hair has been looking since I starting using it.<br /><br />I guess the other comments on Amazon not being an authorized dealer and therefore voiding the warranty can be a deterrant, but being able to save $100 compared to retail was significant enough for me to take a chance on that.
