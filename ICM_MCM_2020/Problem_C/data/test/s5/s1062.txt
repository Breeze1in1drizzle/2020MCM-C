This is a good hair dryer in a fun color.  The best feature of this hair dryer is the Cool Shot feature, which blows cool air for just a moment.  This is nice if you are starting to overheat from all of the hot air.  And the best part is that it actually gets more powerful rather than less powerful when using the Cool Shot feature.  The only negative is that this hair dryer is a bit big and bulky, but this is not a major problem.  Overall, I like and recommend this hair dryer.
