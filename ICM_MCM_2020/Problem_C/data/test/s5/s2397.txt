We were given one of these pacifiers at the hospital and our son refused any other pacifiers once we got home.  We ordered the six pack because we couldn't sterilize the one fast enough to make the baby happy!  The package arrived quickly.  I like that these pacifiers do not have the deep bump at the end of the nipple (like the pacis meant for 3+ month babies), so they don't catch in his throat and gag him (which is what would happen with other regular shaped pacis).
