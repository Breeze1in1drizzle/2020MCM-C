&#34;...more than you can afford pal.&#34; is not a phrase you should apply here. It's quieter, blows harder, has ionizer or maybe a deionizer, it's red, has an awesome cord.<br /><br />And did I mention its very quiet? Has more of a whooooooooosh shound than typical shrill hair dryer, &#34;Wheeeeeeee-zzzzzzzzzzzz-eeeeee-zzzzzz-eeee-hrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-ddrrrrrrrrrrrrr-wheeeeeeeeesh&#34;
