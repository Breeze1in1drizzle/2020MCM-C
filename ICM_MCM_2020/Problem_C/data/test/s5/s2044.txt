We first found these three years ago when our first was a baby. They are so cute, but are really great because it is harder to lose than just a soothie. They can not roll out of the crib in the middke of the night and a child can easily find it in their crib and put it back in their mouth when they want it. My daughter is two and still has hers, but she got a hold in the soothie part and was very upset. It wpuld be nice to be able to change those out. We just sewed a new one on. It doesn't look that great but she loves it!
