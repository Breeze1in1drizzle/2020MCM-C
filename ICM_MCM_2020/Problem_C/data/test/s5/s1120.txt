As my hair has gotten longer, I've suddenly seen the need for for a hairdryer.  I'm a Man, but let me just say Mangroomer is a brand.  There's no reason women can't use this dryer as well, since Male and Female hair is pretty much the same.  This unit has worked quite well for my purposes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-High power 1875W motor.<br />-3 heat and 2 speed settings.  I tend to use the lowest heat and highest speed.<br />-Cold air button to finish things off.<br />-Comfy rubber grip.<br />-Long cord.<br />-It looks cool!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Not really sure the magical ion feature actually does anything.<br />-Annoying packaging.<br /><br />This hairdryer does the job and looks cool doing it.  Recommended for men or women who want to be groomered.
