I honestly do not know where this has been my entire life.  I have very thick and wavy hair, this dryer styles my hair in half the time.  I usually would blow dry my hair, put a frizz control then use the flat iron.  With this my hair is healthier, I don't have to use my flat iron as much and I use very little anti-frizz product now. I would reccomend this to anyone who has thick, wavy, or even curly hair and wants to be able to quickly style their hair. I've tried everything thing I could think of to get my hair to straighten easily and efficently and this is the one.  In 32 years, I've never been more in love with any of my hair tools.
