Unlike many other pacifiers, these are made of a single piece of silicone, which eliminates most potential choking hazards. In addition, being made of a single piece of silicone means  they are really easy to clean, which is EXTREMELY important, and they dry thoroughly and quickly. (You can even boil them to sterilize them.)  Other types of pacifiers we've tried  ended up with condensation/water droplets stuck inside them... no good.    Also, if you are concerned about nursing issues, that shouldn't be a problem with these pacifiers. They were recommended to us by a registered nurse who is also a lactation consultant. (Incidentally, she was not a fan of the orthodontic pacifiers.)    FYI, these pacifiers work well with the Booginhead Pacifier Holder.
