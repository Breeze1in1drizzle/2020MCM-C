I thought it was a bunch of nonsense when I read this hair dryer did all these awesome things to your hair, but it actually reduces frizz. I'm not sure if all hair dryers do this or if it's just this hair dryer, but whenever I use it I notice my hair is a lot smoother and easier to brush through. I've had it for 2 years and no problems, definitely would buy again!
