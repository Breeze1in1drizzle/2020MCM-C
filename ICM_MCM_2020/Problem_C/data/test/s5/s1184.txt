This hair dryer is everything I hoped it would be.  It is simple to use and does the job.  I have my hair professionally colored and highlighted.  I have used blow dryers, hot curling irons and hot rollers for many years but the curl and body I get from hair rollers and this dryer is way better and stays curly longer.  My hair actually feels like it did when I was younger.  My only complaint is the dryer came with a broken clip that holds one wheel (of the stand) on and no instruction booklet for use.  I would like to have these things, if possible.
