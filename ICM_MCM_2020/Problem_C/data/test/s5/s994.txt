I really love this little dryer.  It is very professional looking and as others have mentioned it is feels soft and velvety to the touch. It dries my hair quickly and is not too loud, all things considered.  I would say for smoothing it is not a miracle worker, but it does much better than your cheapie dryers, and can help an amateur like me control the frizz somewhat.  I think super smoothing requires more proper technique than just a magic hair dryer.  Unfortunately I am not well versed in that technique, but with this dryer my hair doesn't look too frazzled and out of control.  My only issue with this dryer is that I have very long hair and sometimes when I am using it the hair gets sucked into the fan on the back end of the dryer.  I think this is because this dryer is smaller than my last dryer so I need to adjust for this better. Overall though, its the best quality for the price I have had in a dryer.
