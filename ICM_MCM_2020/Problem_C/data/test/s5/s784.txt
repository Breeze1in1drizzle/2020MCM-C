What a fantastic hair dryer.  It has the cooler setting, but with the same wind power as the high setting so you can get your hair dry and smooth without burning it.  I have owned numerous dryers from Vidal Sassoon and Conair and many other brands, however this is just the best and so well priced.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Andis.
