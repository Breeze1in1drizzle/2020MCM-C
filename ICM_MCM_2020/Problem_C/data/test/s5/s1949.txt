I bought this because it looked so cute online and when we received it, it looked even cuter in person! I love it so much and can't wait for our daughter to arrive in May so she can give it a try. The quality is impressive and much better than most other pacifiers I have seen. Plus you have to admit that it is so much cuter than anything you can buy at Walmart...which is ALL we have around here. I know no other mothers here will have this pacifier which keeps pacifiers from getting mixed up with other babies. I recommend it and other pacifiers made by Personalized Pacifiers! Also, If you go to their website, you can special order one with your babies name on it. :-)
