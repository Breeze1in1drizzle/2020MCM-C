After many attempts to find a pacifier that my son would take we settled on Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature. There is no upside down as with other brands as the symmetrical shape allows for your little one to put the pacifier in all by themselves with no fuss.  Now when someone gives him a different brand he immediately spits it out and reaches for this one.  The 0-6 months pacifiers were used constantly and we never had an issue with any of them wearing out or needing to be replaced.  The only downside is the cute designs on the face will scratch off between being placed in the dishwasher to clean and little fingers grasping for the pacifier.
