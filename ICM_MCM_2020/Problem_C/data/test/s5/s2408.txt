This was the brand given in the hospital. I went home with two. It was a bit of a frustration for the first 6 weeks because my baby could not keep this in his mouth for too long without assistance. However, I wanted to stick with it because it's the only pacifier shaped most similarly to a real nipple, and I didn't want to introduce the chance of nipple confusion with a different pacifier.<br /><br />Right at 6 weeks, he was able to handle it much more consistently. At 8 weeks, he could keep it in his mouth all by himself. Now, at 11 weeks, he's quite a pro! I no longer have to reach over and help him keep it in his mouth.<br /><br />One day I gave him a different pacifier brand (received this different one as a gift), and I noticed that he had some difficulty latching to the breast for that whole day. Back to the Soothie, and no problems since then!  I ordered two packs of the 3+ month size from Amazon. I saw them in Rite Aid, but they were a bit more expensive. It would be perfect if it came with a case. I ordered a separate plastic case.<br /><br />Any basic pacifier clip with Velcro attachment can work to clamp it to baby's shirt. The pacifier has two holes so you can put the strap through the hole and keep it at hand.
