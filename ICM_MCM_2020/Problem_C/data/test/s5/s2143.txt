LOVE this Wubbanub! Got one as a baby gift and frankly thought it was kind of dumb. I mean, if you want a pacifier and a little stuffed animal, why do they need to be stuck together?!? And then when our son still wasn't really hooked on any particular pacifier after the first couple weeks, and after one long evening of paci-spitting and fussing, I figured we might as well try the Wubbanub. Our son loved it pretty much instantly! And the genius design of that stuffed animal meant the paci couldn't drop out of his mouth and get stuck under his neck/head. It rested perfectly on his chest while he was tiny and stayed close and easy to grab when he was a little bigger. And while I fully expected him to abandon it by the time he was crawling, he loves that thing still! It's lightweight enough that he never minded it dangling from his mouth as he became mobile. He's over 20 months now (entering the territory of restricting it to the crib, car, and emotional moments), but it's easy for us to grab and hang onto with a toddler on the go. With him on my hip and the paci in his mouth, the giraffe is long enough that I can hook a leg or tail between my fingers in case he jettisons the thing. I'm actually ordering a new one because he finally chewed a hole in his and I don't have the heart to take it away. Can't believe I'm buying a Wubbanub for my toddler, but a lovey is a lovey for a reason, and he sure does love this giraffe.
