This is a super dryer.  It is very powerful for the small size and low price.  It worked just fine in Ireland, Wales, and England.  At home I use it to dry my dogs.<br /><br />Update July 2013:<br />My review was not for this ProVersa Dryer.<br />I bought a dryer in Summer 2011 but it said First Class on it.  I've seen First Class dryers in hotels so I decided to buy it because it must be dependable.<br />I can't review this dryer honestly as Amazon has perversed my review of the First Class Dryer by playing switcheroo with ProVersa.  I call BS.
