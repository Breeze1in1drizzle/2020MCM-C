I love the travel smart conair 1200 watt for traveling. It is small and packs easily. The wattage is easily changed for travel abroad. It actually had two speeds when I used it in Europe. Often hair dryers have two speeds in the states but when traveling abroad with the change in voltage they do not. I was very happy with the travel smart dryer and will use it each year when we travel abroad. I would highly recommend it for foreign travel.
