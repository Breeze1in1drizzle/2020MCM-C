Great hair dryer, nicely balanced, good air flow, and not too loud. This is one appliance I hate having to replace, as you get so accustomed to one, but this one is if anything an improvement over my old favorite. Dual heat & speed controls are a must for me. Nice inclusion of the extra drying attachments.
