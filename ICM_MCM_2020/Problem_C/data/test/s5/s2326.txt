My daughter has really chubby cheeks. As an infant, the sides of paci's would almost cut into her cheeks. But these particular pacis don't. They curve away from the face a bit. So much more comfortable. They leave NO lines on her face. These are the only pacis that I've found that curve away. The clear color is hard to find once dropped. So stock up!!!
