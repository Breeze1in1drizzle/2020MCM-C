First off, these will only glow if you expose them to light for a while first. Same as any other glow in the dark product. I love the mam pacifiers because my son showed strong favor to them when he was only a month old. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with novelty pacifiers with mustaches and funny sayings. These fit perfectly in baby's mouth no matter how which direction it goes in. Once the baby learns how to put their pacifier in their mouths, it's easy for them to do and since they glow in the dark, it's easy to find in the crib at night. I'm not a fan of the clear ones because they're hard for him to find. To the reviewer who said the pacifiers make her baby drool, that's like saying a specific diaper makes your baby poop. Babies drool. It's a fact of life. Get over it. Also, do yourself a favor and purchase the mam pacifier clips. They're the only ones that work with mam pacifiers.
