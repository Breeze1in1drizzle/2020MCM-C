I bought this cute Binkibear for my 4-M-old son and he fell in love with Binki as soon as he saw it!! He really enjoys cuddling with Binki and plays with it. I even found my son rolling on the bed and still holding it in his arm!LOL The only thing I didn't satisfy is my son doesn't like the pacifier attached on Binki, but I think it's not a big deal, I can buy other pacifier to replace it.
