My son loves NUK at all times. He is 4.5 months now. we try to avoid the paci during day. In the night we let him have one.<br /><br />NUK fits his mouth perfectly. He does spit it out once in a while but mostly he holds it in..<br /><br />Soothie - well he doesn't recognize soothie as a pacifier. For some reason, he doesn't suck on it most of the days. Even when he is cranky, he will not suck on soothie for long. Probably the shape of it doesn't appeal to him. I cannot talk about how habit forming it is, as my son is just 4.5 months old.<br /><br />NUK Pros:<br /><br />My son loves it, he is able to hold it in his mouth for long periods<br />Orthodontic, so I worry less about my sons teeth allignment<br /><br />NUK cons:<br /><br />Water enters the nub when I wash the paci. I squeeze and shake to get it out.<br />Sometimes when he sucks it for too long, the shape of the exterior of the paci leaves an impression around his lips.<br />In amazon, pink color and green color are paired, boy colors are not exclusive.
