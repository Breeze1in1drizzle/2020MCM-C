These are the only pacifiers my daughter will take, and they are hard to find nowadays. You don't get to choose specific colors, but who cares? Your baby couldn't care less about what color their sucky is, but if you're the type who gets butt-hurt if you don't get everything the same color or if your boy has a pink paci, look elsewhere!
