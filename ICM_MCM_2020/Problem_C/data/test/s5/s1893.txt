The paci given at the hospital was the only one our son would take.   This wubbanub has the paci just like the hospitals.  It's just heavy enough to stay in place so you aren't constantly having to put the paci back in your infant's mouth.  Then, when your baby is old enough they can hold on to the wubbanub's ears or paws and put it in their mouth all by themselves.  Great for them to carry around when they are older and most importantly the paci is big enough that when dropped it never rolls away - we never lost one!  We bought three.  toss in washer.  It's a perfect shower gift.
