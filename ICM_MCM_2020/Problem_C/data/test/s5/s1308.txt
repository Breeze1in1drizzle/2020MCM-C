LOVE LOVE LOVE! this is the best hair dryer I've ever seen. It's really light, very quiet, and dispenses a small burst of cool air from above the nuzzle, which is unexpectedly brilliant. It also folds so it doesn't take too much space in my luggage when I travel. The chord is a bit too short, but with an extension is fine.
