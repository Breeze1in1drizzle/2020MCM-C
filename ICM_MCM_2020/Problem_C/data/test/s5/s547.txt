I researched various black on-wall hairdryers and I liked that this one was compact and a cord that seemed like it would stay out of the way. I mostly purchased this for when the girls are at the house and need a hairdryer, but it's actually come in handy for me as well. Anyway, mount and forget this thing. The cord for how I mounted it does slop around on the counter top a bit, but you really need that to have a comfortable amount of distance to use it.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm very into more modern looking gadgets and the compactness of this and sleek black made it a great fit. After two-years, it's still working great and gets a decent amount of use. No problems whatsoever.
