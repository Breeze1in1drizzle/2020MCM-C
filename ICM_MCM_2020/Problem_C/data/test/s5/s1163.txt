I am a former hair dresser of the 60's and 70's .All hair services were done with roller sets and a time under a hair dryer.So I feel qualified to rate this dryer. IT ROCKS! The heat and air circulation are great. Temperature and timer controls are simple and easy to use. The hood has a clear lift up portion on the hood front that allows easy access to the dryer. Best of all,its quiet. Instructions for assembly are very vague. Just use your common sense and look at the pictures and you'll figure it out. I had mine together and running in about 15 minutes. For the money I don't think you could go wrong. The only thing I would change is the plastic legs. But what isn't plastic these days? Good buy.
