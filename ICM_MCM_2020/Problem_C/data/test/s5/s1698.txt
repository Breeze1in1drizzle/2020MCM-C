I was a little worried about the quality of this trim kit after reading previous reviews.  But the thing is beautiful!  My husband had to do some work to fit the thing in our space.  The results were wonderful.  And now I have a built-in microwave in stainless steel to match my other newer appliances.  The look is very nice.
