These are the best pacifiers by far for new born/ infants... It makes it easier to hold the pacifier in the baby's mouth and for them to find it in the middle of the night. The little animals give them something to hold onto...  We bought at least 10 of these on Amazon for our daughter and as gifts...  A+++++ product...
