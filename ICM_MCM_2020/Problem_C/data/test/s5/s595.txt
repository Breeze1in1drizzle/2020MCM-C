I bought this hair dryer to replace an old Conair 1875 watt one.  The old one was at least 12yrs. old and was still working, but making strange noises so I decided to look for its replacement before it died at an inopportune time!  This dryer is great.  It has a lot more 'wind' power than the old one did but it does not seem to get as hot, which with the power is not an issue...it does not burn my head if I stay in one place too long as the old one did.  The case is easy to hold, the dual controls are different, but better than the one it replaced.  I would recommend this hair dryer without any negative issues.  I did not want to spend a lot of money for an ion dryer and this one is perfect.  It leaves my hair much softer and manageable and does a good job of drying hair fast.  The Amazon statement did not mention 'ion'...but on the box it states it is an 'ion' dryer.
