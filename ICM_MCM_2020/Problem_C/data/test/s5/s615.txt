I already owned this blow dryer, but purchased a second one for travel. I really like this dryer for it's ease of use, temperature and air settings.  I like that the operating buttons are a slide up and down. This is a great feature since you don't accidentally turn the blow dryer off or change the settings while you are drying your hair, like other dryers with elevated buttons. I have a lot of hair and it's thick and this blow dryer, drys it very quickly. The heat is not overly hot, it's just right! The lower settings are perfect for styling. The dryer is also light weight. The price is lower than anywhere else and it arrived quickly and no shipping!
