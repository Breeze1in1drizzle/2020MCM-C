Our son received his first red dog wubbanub paci while in the NICU and after he was released later I soo understood why the nurses loved these pacifiers. My son who just turned 4 months old is not a great paci sucker even though he likes to fall asleep with it, but his Wubbanub helps him by staying in place! I just love that they are very easy to find...havent lost one yet!..and he has three!
