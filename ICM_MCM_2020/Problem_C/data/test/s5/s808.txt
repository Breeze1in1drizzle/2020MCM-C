Used this dryer in hotel and liked it so much that I searched online and found it at great price on Amazon.  Dryer is compact, dries hair fast and heat setting is not too hot.  You have option of mounting on wall bracket or not.  I use as home dryer and also take with me for travel.  Great little dryer and prefer over many other name brand hair dryers I have purchased in the past.
