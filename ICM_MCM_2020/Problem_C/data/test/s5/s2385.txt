My daughter loves these and so do I. She has chubby cheeks and all he other pacifiers leave marks on her face but these ones do not. She has taken them so well I bought some for my nephew, who did not take a pacifier well and he really liked them also. They have now made the switch also. One WARNING though is that as they get older my daughter  (7 months) who will only take the 0-6 pacifiers likes to chew on the sides and at times has even put almost the whole pacifier in her mouth. Because it is flexible she is able to get it all the way in, because of this we don't let her take it to bed anymore. Other than that we love them!
