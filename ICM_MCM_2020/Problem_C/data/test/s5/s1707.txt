Setting it up it is the only issue.  It is very specifically for counter-top use only and it has an EXTREMELY short cord.  The cord doesn't even reach to the far side of the microwave.  Expect to need an extension cord.  The unit is a tiny bit smaller than average, but not much.  It has a pull down door that doesn't lay flush when opened, which may be a problem for larger dishes, but I've yet to encounter an issue.  There is an internal light that turns on when the unit is operating and when the door is open.  It runs a lot quieter than any microwave I've ever seen, and does so in all four modes (microwave, convection oven, air fryer, and toaster oven/grill).  There is no timer, which I found odd, but I've been using the phone for that for so long, I barely notice.<br /><br />The settings make it super easy to use.  You can auto-reheat a dinner plate or a casserole with a single feature.  There is a convenient popcorn button.  I've heard stories of a friend without that feature trying to pop up a bag of microwave popcorn.  Six people.  One microwave.  No viable popcorn.  No such problem here.  One button and let it pop.<br /><br />There are also auto-cook features for pasta, beverage, chicken breast, frozen breakfast, and frozen dinner.  What? No frozen lunch?<br /><br />The air fry (or slim fry, however you want to call it) feature worked well for me, though I only tried homemade french fries.  It only works for this list of pre-programmed items:<br /><br />Frozen oven chips (aka french fries)<br />Frozen breaded prawns<br />Frozen chicken nuggets<br />Frozen potato croquettes<br />Frozen onion rings<br />Chicken wings<br />Homemade french fries (there is a recipe in the guide and it's good to read it first if you've never air fried these before)<br />Potato wedges<br />Drumsticks<br /><br />For using it as a toaster oven, or grill (it seems like they use the terms interchangeably) you put the thing you want to toast/grill on the high rack (included, as is the lower rack) and select grill.  For medium dark toast, I go three minutes on each side.  It comes it shockingly good, same as from any toaster.  I had low expectations for that one, but it worked really well.<br /><br />Overall, it does everything it says it does, and it does it very well.
