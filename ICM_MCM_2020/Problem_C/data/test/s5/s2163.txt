There are so many reasons your child will love this bear!  I had two wubanubs for our infant, which is all well and good.  But when he grew out of the infant pacifier and was teething, he couldnt use them anymore, they are sewn in!  This binky bear I was able to attach a teething binky to him! And take it off and put a different binky on another day, my son prefers this bear at bed time now because he cuddles him! I love the binky bear!
