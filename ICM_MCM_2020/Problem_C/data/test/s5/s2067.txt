great price for two bags, one is very small, used to hold two or three pacis, i use mine to hold eye drops, chapstick, tissues, wet naps, and glucose tabs. the large one isn't something i'd use to hold a whole days worth of dirty diapers but when i'm out of town for then evening it can hold 4 maybe 5 if i roll them up (prefolds and insert together) well. and it keeps the smell in very well too! wish it did zipper instead of tie though.<br /><br />edit after a year of use I still use this product, I lost the smaller bag a while ago, but still use the large one, it did tear at the seam where the ties are, and i have yet to fix it, but use it none the less! keeps the stink in very well!
