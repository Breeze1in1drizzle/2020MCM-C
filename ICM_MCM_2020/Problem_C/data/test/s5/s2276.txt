[[ASIN:B004IY6AGW Mary Meyer Ella Bella Elephant Wubbanub]]<br /><br />I LOVE WUBBANUB'S! What more could I say? This is my second Wubbanub purchase.I ordered one for DBG before she was born with hopes that she would take to it and she did!We have used our first one which was a small pink monkey now for nearly three months and it has been through a lot and still holding up.I wanted to have another as a back up.I ordered the ELLA BELLA Wubbanub because it was just too cute.We finally got it and I am very pleased with it.It is super soft and super cute.It is a good size not too small and not too big...just right and it's not heavy at all,just enough weight to it to help it stay where you want it to.I washed it and tried to give it to DBG and she would have nothing to do with it :( to my suprise.I decided to let her sleep with it for a few days along with her monkey Wubbanub and it worked! I realized that the reason she did not take to the new one at first was because it did not smell familar to her.Now she loves it as much as her monkey and I can wash the other one finally...as she will not do without one :) It is PERFECT in every way,it's a pacifier and her lovey/security,she will only take the pacifier when she's sleepy but she will grasp the legs and hold on tight and cuddle with it.BEST OF ALL: I don't have to dig for a paci EVER!It is so easy to find any time any where.She has a hard time holding one in her mouth(preemie) and this helps her to keep it there and when she does not want it she can just move her head and it falls out/away but stays with her.These are very durable.One of my baby shower gifts from now on.<br />Suggestion on washing:I take a mesh bag(zipped) or pillowcase(tied at the end) and drop the Wubbanub in and throw it in the washing machine on gentle cycle,let it air dry then wash the pacifier with warm/hot soapy water or use a pacifier wipe and we are good to go.<br />I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS ITEM OR ANY WUBBANUB :)
