This is the best pacifier out there for breastfed babies or babies who will only take the one from the hospital. My son wouldn't take any other pacifier but the one from the hospital. I tried every kind. This pacifier is amazing because it creates a sucking motion like that during breastfeeding. I buy them in bulk! I would not use any other kind for my child.
