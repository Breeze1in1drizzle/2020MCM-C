I'm a professional stylist. This dryer is powerful, it works great for any type of hair. The 2 nozzles give me options to how to distribute the air flow according to the density of the hair, I really like it! Great for professionals and personal use too. You can't go wrong with Twin Turbo, they are great dryers. Thank you.
