I have always had difficulty using the round brush and a normal hair dryer to straighten my hair.  My arms would get so tired.  With the Andis 82105 Ceramic Ionic Styler Hair Dryer, I am able to make my spiral curl hair straight in 1/2 the time that it used to.  I have been getting so many compliments on my hair since I bought it!
