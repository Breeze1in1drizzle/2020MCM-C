I am a 60-something female and as you can imagine have owned my share of hairdryers over the years but I have to tell you that this is the best and a real bargain at the price!  I am ordering more for gifts.  It is very lightweight and the fastest dryer I have ever owned. My only regret is that I did not find this one years ago.  You will not be disappointed with this one.
