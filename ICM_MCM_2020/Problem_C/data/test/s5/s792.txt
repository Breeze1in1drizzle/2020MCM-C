Dries my extremely thick, long hair quickly.  I use leave-in conditioner, brush out with my Wet Brush and then use the comb attachment to dry.  It takes &#60;10 min.  This is unheard of for me.  Its also fairly quiet.  My friends are sick or hearing about it so, I thought I'd tell Amazonians... I really love this hair dryer!
