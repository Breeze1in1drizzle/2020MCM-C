My daughter is 2 months old.  When she was born they gave a soothie pacifier at the hospital. She won't take any other pacifier and they are easy to lose and impossible to find in the dark.  This product is great because you can find it in the dark, it help to keep it in easier by having the monkey laying on her chest, and when she is not sucking on the pacifier she is holding the monkey.   This may be the most valuable purchase we made for our little addition
