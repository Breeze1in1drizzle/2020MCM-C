We were given this pacifier in the hospital, and it is the only one that my little girl has ever had.  She LOVES it, and so do I!  I was so glad when I found them to order since we were only given 1 at the hospital.  I have recommended them to several friends who have used them and love them as well.  It is sturdy, yet soft and comfortable for the baby.  Before my little girl was born, I had bought MAM pacifiers since that is what my first daughter used (until she started sucking her thumb), but when I compared the Gumdrop to the MAM, it was so much softer without that plastic shell around the outside.    I would HIGHLY recommend this pacifier to anyone having a baby.  In fact, I think this will be my new shower gift for all moms!!
