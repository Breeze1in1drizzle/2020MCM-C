I have very thick and corse - curly/wavy hair and I love this hair dryer!! It's nice and compact but has a lot of power. It dries my hair in half the time it used to with other bigger, more expensive dryers. I first used this in a hotel I stayed at and came on here the minute I got home to order it. For me, it's been so worth it! Love this!!
