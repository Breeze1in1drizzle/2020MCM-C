This thing really pack a punch. Perhaps they have to make the outlet diameter larger than others so the wind pressure isn't too great on the head and hair. This thing isn't slim but not too big nor too heavy. My just turn teen daughter like it and find it not too big or heavy.<br /><br />From out many broken hair dryers ceramic is certainly heat more even than non-ceramic ones. But since we mainly use it to dry rather than style, I'm not sure fancy ceramic is really better than ceramic. There is only one rocker button for cool / turbo. The other buttons are large slide buttons so you can't accidentally change the settings. The finish is quality hard glossy plastic. I will not buy non-slip rubbery finishes again as they degenerate in no time.<br /><br />So far so good for a couple of months. But I think they realized that they made a big mistake by not marketing it only to salons, with a price to match. I would love to have another one to replace my daughter's broken one but now it sells for 10 times the price I paid.
