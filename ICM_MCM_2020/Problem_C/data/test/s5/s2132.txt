We just got this in the mail this past weekend and my son loves it! At 2 1/2 months he is able to place the paci back in his mouth when it falls out. He even likes to chew on the giraffes ears and arms! Before he did not like to take the pacifier and would only keep it in his mouth for a minute or two. Now it stays!
