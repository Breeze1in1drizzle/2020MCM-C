My wife (who doesn't speak / write English by the way, hense not writing this herself) especially likes the attachments and overall quality of this dryer, the three heat settings which provide just the right range, as well as the no heat / blow only setting.<br /><br />But she says the blower is far too strong and wonders why it doesn't provide a lower setting than hurricane strength.  I can only guess that this is because if the heat setting is on high there has to be a minimum amount of fan strength to keep the unit from catching fire.<br /><br />I imagine that a professional hair stylist has the advantage of being able to hold the dryer some distance away from a customer's head and that's why it's so hot and blows so strong, but of course someone using it on themselves doesn't have that advantage.<br /><br />Ceramic is nice, as well as the ion emissions.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Despite complaining about the strength of the fan, she already tossed her old dryer and uses this one because it is a professional level item.  I imagine she'll get used to the fan strength.
