My daughter started eating oranges from this at 6 months old and she loves it. We use it about weekly.  It also doubles as a teether.  Some say it is hard to open and close.  It is a bit tough, so for you grandparents with arthritis,  you may have a hard time.  It just takes a pit of patience.  Otherwise I found it to be a very sturdy product. As far as the mesh netting goes, I have had no discoloration on mine after 3 months of use it still looks new.  I boil my daughters bottles and I just dip the mesh in the boiling water.  They do make replacement netting if your concerned about the coloring.
