I have 4a/b natural hair and I don't like to use direct heat (blow dryer/flat iron) on it very often. I ordered the dryer because I often don't have the time to wait around for my hair to air dry after washing/conditioning and styling. This dryer is great. It was easy to assemble and seems to be durable. The tempature and timer settings work well. It get's the job done!
