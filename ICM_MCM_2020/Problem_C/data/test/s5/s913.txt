I had a little difficulty finding a surface to put it on that would match up with a seat that I had to be high enough up into the hood.  If you're short like me (5'2&#34;), you can't just put in on the dining room table and use one of its chairs.  It would be helpful if the advertizing text stated how high the top of the inside of the hood was from the surface on which the dryer rested.
