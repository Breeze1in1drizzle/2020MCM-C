My mom used MAM bottles with us 24 years ago, so my first choice when picking a bottle and pacifier system was MAM. Our newborn took these at two days old. Absolute lifesaver when she's overtired and wants to comfort suckle when I can't just drop what I'm doing (usually changing her) and let her comfort nurse. We had 0 nipple confusion problems with these. She's gone back and forth from breast to bottle from day one. The self-sterilising feature is life-saver number two. Much easier to just pop them in the microwave than to boil anything.
