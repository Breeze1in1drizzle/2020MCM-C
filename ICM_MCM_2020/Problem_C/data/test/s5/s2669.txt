We knew with our second child time was going to be short and precious. With our first daughter I remember all the hours spent sanitizing and drying bottles. This time around we decided to invest in this device and are happy we did.<br /><br />There isn't much to say beyond it does what it is supposed to, it saves us an enormous amount of time and that makes it worth the money. Once or twice a day we collect used bottles, rinse them and remove anything major using a bottle brush and then load them up into the Baby Brezza. Usually we do this before going to bed.<br /><br />It works its magic and bottles come out sparkling and dry. It is a decent amount of money for something you can do for free. So the real question is what is your time worth? For our family a lot and any little device like this that can give us our time back is well worth the cost.
