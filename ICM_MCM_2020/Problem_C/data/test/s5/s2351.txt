I bought a couple WubbaNubs and they really help the little one keep the pacifier in her mouth.  My little one isn't old enough yet to find the WubbaNub and put it back in her mouth at night, but we find it helps when riding in her car seat, sitting in her swing or laying on the floor.  I definitely recommend this item.
