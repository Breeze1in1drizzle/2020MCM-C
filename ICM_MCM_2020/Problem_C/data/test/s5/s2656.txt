My baby uses munchkin latch bottles, and these are his favorite pacifiers.  I gave him many options, but he chose to match bottle to paci.  Also, just and FYI ... I breastfeed and don't have problems switching back and forth.  I'm not sure if that is kid dependant or has something to do with the brand.
