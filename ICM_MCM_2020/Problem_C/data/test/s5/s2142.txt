I was a bit skeptical about this product early on in baby's life as it seemed hard for her to keep it in her mouth, not to mention she preferred the Nuk brand more. However, I became a convert around the five month mark when I started putting baby to sleep with this guy in her crib and found that she was able to find the pacifier when it fell out thanks to the critter attached. I even went so far as to buy another one because it was working so well. Even though my daughter is now almost eight months, we still use these as her 'night-time' pacifiers for the reason above. Not to mention I think she finds comfort even in holding onto the animal even if the pacifier is out of her mouth. Another idea I read about in a magazine is to cut the pacifier off when you are trying to wean baby. This still allows them to have something familiar and cozy, but the paci is gone. Food for thought!
