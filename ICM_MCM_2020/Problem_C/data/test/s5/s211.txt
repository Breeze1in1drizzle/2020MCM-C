I bought this dryer about a month ago exclusively for travel, but I like it so well that I've been using it for my regular one.  I like that the retractable cord keeps my counter looking uncluttered, but it doesn't always retract as easily as it should.  I sometimes have to coax the cord back in the handle, but to me, it's a tolerable hassle (especially for the price point).  The dryer is very powerful.  I have a ton of hair and the wattage really minimizes the time it takes me to get my hair dry.  The ceramic element also minimizes the static I experience with most other hair dryers.  Overall, it has a few flaws, but for $19.99 it's a heck of a dryer.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have had this over a year now and it's still going strong after daily use.  Love this thing!
