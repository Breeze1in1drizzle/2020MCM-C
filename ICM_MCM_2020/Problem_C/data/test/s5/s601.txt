I think pretty much all has been said in the above reviews. It dries hair quickly, but doesn't damage it by being too hot, nor does it make it frizzy. It is not too loud - it is not exactly quiet, but nothing dramatic. It is not too heavy either. And it's a good deal! I have had it since a month and I actually go through the trouble of blowdrying my hair much more often now, because my hair looks so nice now. (Well, not that I was a monster before).
