We love our Wubbies! I originally got the elephant and the giraffe as baby gifts when my son was first born. We have since added the cat, dragon, and owl to our collection and have them stationed around the house and in the diaper bag. My son likes all the animals, but the Owl is by far his favorite. He loves to look at Wubby's eyes and now that he's old enough to hold onto it, he carries it around everywhere. I feel like the Wubbanubs are a good way to start working on hand control and dexterity and my husband loves them because they are easier to catch than just the pacifier when they fall/get tossed. As for cleaning, we give our Wubbies a bath several times a week by putting the pacifier end in boiling water (we call it the Wubby watering hole). I've also washed all our Wubbies multiple times using a garment bag and they do really well (our giraffe popped a seam in the wash, but it was easy to sew back up). To rank all the Wubbanubs we have:<br />1.Owl: Our favorite Wubby. Before he could hold onto it, my son could hug it making it the easiest Wubby to carry around since I didn't have to hold it. The eyes are like magic, my son loves to look at the owl's eyes. Now that he's teething, he also likes to chew Wubby's feet and the edge of the pacifier. It has done great in the wash and will be a great little stuffed toy when we are done with the pacifier.<br />2.Giraffe: This was the first Wubbanub we got and I think it's great for little babies since it's light and thin. My son seems to like the contrasting colors and when he was just learning to grasp things, the giraffe was easiest because it has the two horns a thin neck and a tail to hang onto. It's also very cute and is our second favorite.<br />3. Dragon: The dragon has fun colors (red/blue/orange) and is chunky like the owl so it's easy for little ones to hang onto. The body is thick, but the wings are easy for little hands to grab. Not my son's favorite, but it's pretty cute.<br />4. Cat: Cute colors, and myson likes the kitties feet. It's nothing too exciting, we use it as the back-up most of the time.<br />5. Elephant: Also a chunkier Wubbanub. It hasn't been our favorite, but as my son gets older he's liking it more and more. When we first got it we rarely used it just because it was really big for a tiny baby. At three months old, my son is starting to pay more attention to the elephant's ears and can hang onto its body so we're using it more and more.
