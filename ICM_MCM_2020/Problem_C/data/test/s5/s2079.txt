I bought this pacifier cast is a good size and fits 2 Soothies in it!  The hook is perfect to hook onto the outside of your diaper bag.  The case has holes in it to prevent moisture from building up inside if the pacifiers were wet.  The case is BPA free which is another plus.  Looks like it comes in orange and blue, but you can't choose your own color when you order it, you get what they give you.  I received the orange and it's perfect since it stands out on my dark diaper bag.
