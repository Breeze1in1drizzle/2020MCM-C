Admittedly, I don't have a ton of hair, and while this is a really nice blow dryer, if you're a guy with short hair, it's pretty extravagant.<br /><br />My wife and daughter, on the other hand, noticed a huge difference. My daughter isn't a huge fan of getting her hair dryed, and happily, this dryer reduces the torture time exponentially. I want to say the difference is in the diffuser, but there's more going on here. It isn't quite &#34;magical&#34;, but it's close.<br /><br />The &#34;magical&#34; part is probably with my wife's naturally curly hair. During the winter months, there's been some investment in products that control frizz, and I've been able to casually tell a difference between products. With this hair dryer, though, you'd swear some really expensive salon-grade stuff was used. The results are pretty surprising, and seem to last. I'd almost go as far as saying that this could save money, by reducing (or eliminating) the need for control products.<br /><br />At first, I was positive there was no way this hair dryer would be worth the money, but seeing how well it works with everyone in the family, I'd totally recommend it to anyone with curly hair, or who can't tolerate much time under the dryer.
