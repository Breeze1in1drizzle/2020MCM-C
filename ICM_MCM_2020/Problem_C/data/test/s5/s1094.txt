I've had this dryer for a few months now and it's fantastic. I have loooooong thick frizzy hair and has cut my drying time in half. Comes in a fancy box, looks nice and shiny and does the job. Since it's a professional tool, it has an extra long cord, which i like. It's not super big so i've even packed it in my carry on for vacation (it's not exactly small either, but it was worth to bring it with me and not have to use the little dryer the hotel offers).
