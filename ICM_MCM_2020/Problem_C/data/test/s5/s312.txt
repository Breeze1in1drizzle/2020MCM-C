I have owned an Andis hair dryer before and loved it- I had to leave it when I sold my home.  I quickly ordered a new one for my present home (a slightly upgraded version) and am extremely pleased.  It is very quiet and the nightlight is very useful during the night.  I would highly recommend this dryer.
