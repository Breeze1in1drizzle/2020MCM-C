This is my new favorite hair dryer.  It has numerous settings so I can get the heat and air flow that I want for various sections of my hair.  The balance is good and it is not too heavy, which tends to be a problem with other hair dryers with this excellent level of air flow volume. I wish it had a retractable cord, but that would add bulk that I would probably be unhappy with!
