Is a combination microwave oven worth the extra cost?  This SAMSUNG COUNTER TOP GRILL MICROWAVE certainly is.  I've used the &#34;combi&#34; button (30% microwave power combined with a single-temperature top heating element) along with the &#34;crusty plate&#34; and grill rack to cook bacon, hamburgers, and frozen hamburgers.  All came out tasting like grilled meats (not microwaved meats).<br /><br />The regular microwave features work like any standard microwave.  The interior is easy to clean.  The microwave door is a mirror that takes a little getting used to (see the attached photo).  The only thing I don't like about this appliance is that the mirrored door won't allow you to watch your food while it's cooking.<br /><br />This is a beautiful kitchen appliance that performs the function of both a microwave and a toaster oven.  But everything cooks with the speed of a microwave.  At 950 watts, the microwave is a little less powerful than my old 1000-watt Sears microwave, so I need to set it for slightly longer cooking and reheating times.<br /><br />***Cleaning Tip:  If you grill bacon, you'll get grease splatter on the roof of the microwave.  Bon Ami removes this easily, without scratching the interior.
