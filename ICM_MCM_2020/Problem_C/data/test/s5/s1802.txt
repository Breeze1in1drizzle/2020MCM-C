Gerber NaturalFlex Silicone Pacifier - Green / Blue    This is the one and only pacifier that I have found that my nephew will keep in his mouth.  All of the others we tried, we had to sit there and hold them in while he sucked them or they would just pop out.  Plus some of our friends are very amazed that you can look down inside the pacifier and see them actually sucking it. Great pacifier, used this style on one of my Grandchildren, and this is an updated version.  I love it, more important he loves it.
