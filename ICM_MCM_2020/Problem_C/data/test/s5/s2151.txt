We actually got two wubbanub's as gifts and ended up purchasing another because they are so great! All wubbanub animals aren't equal. The turtle is great for when your little one is lying/sitting fairly still since it can lay flat on their chest.  We also have an elephant and a giraffe.  We have the elephant in the crib since you can make it 'stand' for when she lies onber side, makeing it the perfect height (upside down worked best when very small). The giraffe as you would imagine has a long skinny neck so it flops around more. Great for when they can wrap their arms or hands around it to hold it in, but bad when they move their head alot as it tends to get flung or stuck under their head.
