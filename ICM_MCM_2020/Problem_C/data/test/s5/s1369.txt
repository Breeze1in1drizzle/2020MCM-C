This is the only diffuser of this variety I've ever found that has short fingers.  Normally the fingers are so long that it is impossible to get the heat close enough to my hair to not take forever to dry.  (I hated those long fingers when I had long hair, and I still hate them now that I have short [not even to my chin] hair!)  This diffuser does blow hair around a bit more than a traditional diffuser (for example, the old school ones w/ the black foam-like material), but this doesn't bother me since my curls are uneven in texture and lend themselves to a beach-y, messy type of look.  Might cause frizz for tight curls, though.
