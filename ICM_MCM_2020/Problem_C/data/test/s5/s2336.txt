My 3rd child is a pacifier baby. Didn't need one with my first two. I have tried dozens of them, from Dr. Browns to Nuk, to First years and so on. This is THE BEST PACIFIER Hands down!! My son loves it and it stays in his mouth! No funny marks from the pacifiers that have the harder outer ring that suctions to your babies face!<br /><br />These Avent pacifiers are BPA Free, which is the only way to go! I'm very particular about what my baby puts in his mouth (product wise) He's got a very hard sucking action to him and I am now using the 3 month and older pacifier but let me tell you, you will NEVER go back to another pacifier after purchasing these! Way to go Avent! Great product! BPA Free! Great design that leaves NO facial marks either! The best!
