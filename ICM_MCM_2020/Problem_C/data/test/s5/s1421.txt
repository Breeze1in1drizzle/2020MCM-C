We bought this microwave for our kitchen remodel partly because we also have this same unit in our motorhome.<br />The combination of an outside hood vent, range light, convection oven, and microwave made it a bargain as well.<br />The shipping was perfect. It was packed in 2 boxes, first the manufacture's styro lined box, then that box was bubble wrapped and boxed in a separate larger box.<br />The stainless steel matches our other appliances and looks great!<br />Thanks Sharp, Thanks Amazon
