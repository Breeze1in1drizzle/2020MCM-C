I ordered this off Amazon as it was half the price of Target.  I was worried that it wouldn't be powerful enough or hot enough as I have long (middle of my back) thick hair.  It works just like a bigger dryer and is the size of my hand.  I travel all summer and never take a blow dryer with me because they take up too much room.  Got this dryer and Remington Travel curlers...its all good.  Both are great for traveling and work better than I expected.
