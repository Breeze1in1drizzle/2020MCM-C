I bought this hair dryer after researching for more than probably 20 hours to figure out which one would fit my needs, etc. It has been well worth it! My hair dries more quickly and I'm getting awesome results with my round brush like I usually get at the salon. I would definitely recommend this product.<br /><br />Even though I would recommend this product, I am highly disappointed to find out that buying through Amazon and a 3rd party I am not covered by the warranty because neither of the companies are authorized resellers of the product. I found this out as I was completing the warranty form that has to be sent in. Had I known this ahead of time I would have gone to one of the authorized seller sites and paid $2 more to have a 1 year warranty. I am returning to Amazon as one of the authorized sellers has 20% off and no tax.
