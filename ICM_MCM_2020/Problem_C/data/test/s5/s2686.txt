We love wubbanubs, and this one is cute & unique.  I like to have several because I wash them in batches on the gentle cycle, in a lingere bag with Dreft.  That keeps them from getting too funky.  My one year old is OBSESSED with these &#34;doos,&#34; because they are easy for her to find and manipulate.  Way more affordable on Amazon, than at a specialty baby store.  Thanks AMAZON, you're my huckleberry!
