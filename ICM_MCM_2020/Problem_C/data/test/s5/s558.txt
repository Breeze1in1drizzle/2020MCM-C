I ordered this for my craft room to help glue dry.  I wanted something small so it was easy to store.  It is the perfect size and has two speeds which makes it great when working on crafts.  I do wish it had hook or something from which I could hang it.  it arrived on time in good packaging.  I would even consider buying another for when we travel because of it size and weight.
