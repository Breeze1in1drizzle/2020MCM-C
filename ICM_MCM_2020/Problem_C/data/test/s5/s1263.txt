This is a great hairdryer and it is very quiet compared to others I've had. I am very happy with this purchase. I keep it on neutral ions for the most part. I haven't noticed a big difference between the 2 ion settings, but I wasn't expecting to anyway. It seems like a gimmick. I was more concerned with having multiple speeds and heat settings which this has.
