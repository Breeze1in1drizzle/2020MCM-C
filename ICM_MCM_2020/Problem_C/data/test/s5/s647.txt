I've had this hairdryer for years now and it works just as well as it did the day I bought it. High-powered and hot, which creates the perfect blowout with or without a round brush. I really love this hair-dryer, and I take it with me whenever I travel.<br /><br />Update--- 2 years post review and it's still going strong!
