This is the most awesome product EVER!! I highly recommend it! My son is tongue tied which means he can't stick out his tongue. All the other pacifiers would constantly pop out of his mouth. I would have to hold it in for him. With this, the little animal hold in his nu-nu. This is my 3rd child and all three have this condition which is not able to be surgically corrected until 4 months of age. I cannot thank whoever came up with this idea enough! Thank you, thank you, thank you!     Ps- It's next to impossible to lose!
