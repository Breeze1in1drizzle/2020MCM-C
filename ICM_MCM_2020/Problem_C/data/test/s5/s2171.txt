We bought this pacifier as well as the Natursutten pacifiers. Our son definitely prefers this pacifier and won't even taken the Natursutten. As some other reviewers have noted, the nipple on the Ecopiggy is on the larger side and is larger than the Natursutten. Maybe which pacifier your baby prefers depends on whether he or she is breastfeeding and the size of the mom's nipples. The rubber is very similar between the two brands. Some reviewers complain about the smell of rubber pacifiers, but I didn't find either of them to have strong smells at all.
