We tried this pacifier out after trying many different ones. This is the only pacifier my little one will ( kind of) take! She doesn't like pacifiers and tends to gag with most of them, but she will occasionally take these in the car when she's starting to get fussy. The nipple on these seems smaller than others we've tried so I'm assuming that's the reason.
