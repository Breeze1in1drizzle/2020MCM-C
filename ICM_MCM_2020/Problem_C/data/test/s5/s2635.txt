I purchased I don't know how many pacifiers without success. I received my first MAM in a promotional gift bag and then a friend with a two-year-old sent me a gift of her favorite baby things which also included my second pacifier. This is the only brand that my baby has used since birth, he spits the other pacifiers out after seconds.<br />As time goes on it's important to strategically place pacifiers throughout the house so I went on Amazon to purchase a few. These are slightly more expensive than the price Target offers, but with a newborn you don't really want to go to the store over and over again so Amazon Prime delivers much in 1 to 2 days. Of Course in my sleep deprived blur, I've misplaced them repeatedly so I recommend getting the clip<br />In addition to MAM's design, they make the cleaning easier where the sanitation in the packaging has been useful as well.
