I wasn't sure about spending so much on a hair dryer. I normally just buy the ones at the drug store. This one was recommended to me since my hair is fluffy. It has an extra long cord and a cold shot too. It dries my hair without burning it, and keeps the frizz down without having to use a ton of silicone oil finishing product. I would highly recommend.
