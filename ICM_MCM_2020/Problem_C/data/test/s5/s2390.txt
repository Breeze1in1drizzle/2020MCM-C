Let me start off by saying that Wubbanubs are the best thing since sliced bread!!  They may be a little bit more expensive than your average binky but your sanity, especially in the early days, is priceless.  With that said we are wubbanub addicts in our house.  My son has more than 10 and I will probably buy more (we like to match his binky with his outfit).  'God Bless Plush Lamb' wubbanub is one of the better ones out of the bunch but mine arrived with some stitching and cosmetic defects (I'm hoping this is an isolated issue as we've had no trouble with our other wubbanubs so I'm not deducting from the rating).  I like the way it lays and also the weight, and who doesn't love the sweet innocence of this wubbanub?!  Absolutely precious!  One of my favorites.
