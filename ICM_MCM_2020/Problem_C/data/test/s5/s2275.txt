One of our favorites! This was a lifesaver in the early days with our baby - it's a cute toy that provides visual interest to the baby with the fun patterns, but it was also great because it would stay in place when the pacifier fell out of her mouth and she was usually able to get it back in on her own. Great for situations like driving when you can't get back there to replace a fallen pacifier! I give these as gifts to my friends now when they are expecting. I especially like the Mary Meyer series because they are a little cuter than the standard Wubbanubs.
