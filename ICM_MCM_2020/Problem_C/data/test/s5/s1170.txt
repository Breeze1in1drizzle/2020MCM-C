Excellent. It's very easy to put together, it's not too loud actually I'm watching jeopardy while under the dryer right now! The bell is not too loud when the timer is done. The only annoying thing is you hear the timer ticking but I'm used to that from going to the beauty salon it goes unnoticeable. Delivery was quick and swiftly and customer service was excellent. My hair dried very quick and I didn't even put it on the max heat. I'm African American with shoulder length hair 4c and I never had a perm. I'm glad I purchased this dryer because it is an reasonable price
