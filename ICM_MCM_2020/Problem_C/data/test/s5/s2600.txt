If you're reading this review, you probably already know that Wubbanubs are awesome pacifiers. We use them in the NICU where I've worked, and they are perfect even from the very start.  This review is more about why the owl is the best of the Wubbanubs! We have this one and the giraffe, and I've encountered many others at work and that friends' kids have. This one always seems more sturdy and less floppy than the others. The soothie pacifier is not super light, and the giraffe's head and neck flops all over the place when I'm holding it. My baby is 5 months and she has a hard time getting that one back in her mouth when it falls out. The owl has a thicker neck and is sturdier overall. If the pacifier falls out, my baby can generally put it back in her mouth without having a huge meltdown (this is especially important when driving down the highway and trying not to crash). She also likes to grab his wings and feet. Some of the newer Wubbanubs come in bright/neon colors, but I like that this one looks like a normal animal. And, of course, owls are super in these days! ;) There are a lot of cute Wubbanubs out there, but in my opinion, this one is the best!  The only negative I would say (and this applies to all Wubbanubs and similarly styled pacifiers) is that you really shouldn't let your baby sleep with them! We use ours primarily in the car, but sometime around the house too. We just use a regular Avent pacifier for overnight, though, as stuffed animals are not safe to let them sleep with overnight (especially when very young).
