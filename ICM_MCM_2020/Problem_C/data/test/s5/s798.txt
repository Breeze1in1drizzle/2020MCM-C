I could not find a hair dryer less than 1850 watts in any stores, so searched the net and found this one.  It's great and doesn't blow the fuse in my bathroom (I have an older home with 15 amp fuses)  My old hair dryer finally gave out and it was also a 1200 watt and now it seemed like no one made anything less than 1850 watts.  This is a wonderful little dryer...a space saver and does the job.
