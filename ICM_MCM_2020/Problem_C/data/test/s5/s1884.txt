I first bought this item when my son was a little less than 2 months old. He loved Soothie he got from the hospital but he kept dropping it. I wanted to get this one so that my son could hold it. He absolutely loved it! He went everywhere with it. He also played with it like a toy. Most of the time,this paci was the only way to calm my son down. I washed it in the regular washing machine with rest of his clothes and dried it in a drier with high temp many times and it was still fine. I ended up buying total 4 of them for my son. The difficult part was to get rid of this pacifier from him. He didn't go to sleep with out it. He became so fussy without it. However, last month when my son was 20 month-old, he chewed the soothie badly and tier all of them off. I didn't buy another one for him but I gave him a little teether just to keep something in his mouth when he gets fussy. First 3 days without this paci were very rough but he became fine without it after a few days. Now he is 21 month old, and still chews on teether a few times a day just for a little bit, but he is completely pacifier-free. I am very happy. This pacifier helped my son and my family a lot.
