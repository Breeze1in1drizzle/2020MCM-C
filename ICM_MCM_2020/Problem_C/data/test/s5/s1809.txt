This is the only brand of gum drop I will ever buy.  All the others (first years) are just different and my baby could tell.  This one is exactly like the one from the hospital and he would not even attempt to use the others.  The vanilla scent wasn't as strong as some of the other scented pacifiers out there and that was definitely a plus.  The scent was just enough to be soothing without being overpowering.
