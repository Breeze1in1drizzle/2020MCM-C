I used this hair dryer while staying at a Marriott hotel and loved it.  My hair dries in a much shorter amout of time and comes out soft without the frizz.  The folding handle and retractable cord make it easy to transport and store.  I ordered an ionic hair dryer from my hairdresser which was three times more expensive, didn't work nearly as well, and broke within a year.  My daughter-in-law used it recently and couldn't believe how quickly her hair dried......
