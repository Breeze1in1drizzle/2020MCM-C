...Aren't these just the cutest!! I have a 7 month old son and these binkies made the perfect photo op! He doesn't care for binkies but he managed to keep these in his mouth the longest of any other brand I've tried. (I'm thinking it's the fabulous mustache!) I love that they came with a case so they are easy to travel and you don't have to worry about what might get stuck on them while in the diaper bag or purse. I bought the one black and one brown set- the brown matched his blonde color hair the best, but the black is great too for photos! These would make a great gift for a new little one and surely make a baby a perfect gentleman!
