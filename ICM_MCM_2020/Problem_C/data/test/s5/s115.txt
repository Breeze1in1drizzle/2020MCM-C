I use this to straighten my hair. I love that it is portable, and I can pretty much sit anywhere to dry my hair, which takes about an hour to do. It will overheat if you do not make sure the air vent is not blocked by anything. I have had this for years and use it weekly. I definitely will buy it again if I it ever breaks.
