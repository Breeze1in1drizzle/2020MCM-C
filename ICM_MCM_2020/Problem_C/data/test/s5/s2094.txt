I did a lot of research on pacifiers and these are the only ones we've used. They are rubber, so they do smell like rubber, but that's what I expected and I don't think the smell is strong. My biggest issue has been keeping these away from dog, who has eaten 4 of them (fortunately with zero vet bills...). We got at least a month's use out of each pacifier (assuming the dog didn't eat it first). I would recommend these. A little more expensive than other pacifiers, but worth it to know what is going into my baby's mouth. And FAST shipping!!
