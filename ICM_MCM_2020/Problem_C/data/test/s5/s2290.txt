These have been a must have in my house since my daughter was born. I love them bc they can be used in so many ways...I use for pacifiers, bottles, toys, basically anything that drops or needs a quick clean. Also, no need to get the travel pack bc you can put them in a sealed baggy or I use a really small plastic container that snaps and seals shut. They don't dry out either! My daughter stopped using a pacifier at about 3 1/2 months (she's 5 months now) but I still use them all the time for the above mentioned. Must have!!!! It's also a great shower gift bc that's how I got hooked!
