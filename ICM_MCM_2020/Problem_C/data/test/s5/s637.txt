This is an awesome product. I have a mid length hair and it dries them in 5 mins on high-warm setting. There are 2 settings: one for the temperature and the other for speed. So you can choose between cool-warm-hot on one side and low-high on the other end.  The product was delivered on the said delivery date and it is a great value for money.
