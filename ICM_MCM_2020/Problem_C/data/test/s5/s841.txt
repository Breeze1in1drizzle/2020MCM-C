In my small bathroom, space on the vanity counter is at a premium, this wall mounted unit works works well to take care of the problem.<br /><br />It was easy to mount.  I mounted near the wall electrical plug and had to tie up the excess electrical cord (from the unit to the plug),<br /><br />The unit has two heat settings and two speed settings.
