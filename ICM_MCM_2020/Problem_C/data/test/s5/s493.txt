I like the color, the attachments, and the retractable cord. I didn't feel like the hair dryer was too heavy or too loud. If you blow dry your hair on high then yes it is loud but if you use the lower setting it is actually pretty quiet. I'd buy this again, I think it was a great value for the price.
