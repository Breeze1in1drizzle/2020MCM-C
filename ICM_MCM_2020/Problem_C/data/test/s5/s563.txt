Only been using this for about a week now so I can't speak to the longevity of the dryer but I really love it so far.  Hair dryers have always been kind of hit and miss, mostly miss for me.  They are usually not strong enough, or too hot, or not hot enough, or cheaply made (even expensive ones), etc.  I have thick long hair and it takes forever to dry.  This dryer is amazing.  It has several settings and on the hottest, strongest setting I can dry my hair faster than any other dryer I've had.  But it doesn't get overly hot either.  I don't feel like I'm burning my hair and scalp as I have with other dryers.  As someone who has been on the hunt for the perfect dryer for decades, I feel like I finally found one.  I'm tempted to buy a bunch so I have them for the future in case this one ever goes away.
