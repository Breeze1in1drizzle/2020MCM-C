I feel like a horrible mother since I have not gotten my 3 year old to get rid of these things yet (she went from taking it all the time to just pacifying herself to sleep which is an improvement). However, I love that the nipple mimics the nipple for most bottles, it also helped my baby with colic when she was younger.
