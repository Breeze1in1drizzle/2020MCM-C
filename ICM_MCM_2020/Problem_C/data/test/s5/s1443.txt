great microwave at great price.  i bought one from amazon.com last month for $199.  it arrived in one week.  no shipping charge.  looks great.  works great.  installed easily.  (professionally installed for $65.)  nice clean lines.  easy to operate.  hit the button once for one minute.  hit it again for each additional minute.
