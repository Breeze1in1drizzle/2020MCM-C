My daughter started teething at 3 months and we had great difficulty finding a teether that she liked. After trying the ring and the hand, we fell upon the teething blanket. BEST EVER! It's soft and fuzzy and silky/satiny with 2 chewy corners. She loves grabbing the blankie and chewing on the ends. IT ROCKS!!
