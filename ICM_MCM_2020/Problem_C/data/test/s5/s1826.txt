My baby was given this type of pacifier at Northside Hospital in Atlanta and it is the only one he will take.  They aren't sold in many stores so finding them on Amazon was great.  If you can keep up with these pacifiers they'll last for a long time - the material doesn't break down like the more common brands and the outter portion is great for teething.  I highly recommend this pacifier but make sure you don't order the preemie/newborn kind... they are way too small.
