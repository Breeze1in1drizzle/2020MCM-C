I'm a big fan of Panasonic hair Dryers and the reason why is simply because they leave my hair looking healthy and shiny .<br />fair price and does a great job keeping my hair straight with a bounce and weight in it , I blow dry my hair then use the KURUKURU after I spray my hair with a heat protector .. P.S ( My Hair type is wavy ) :-)
