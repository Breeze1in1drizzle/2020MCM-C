as first time parents, we were given the choice to use a pacifier in the hospital. after much debate b/c of breastfeeeding, we decided to let our son have it b/c our son was just very inconsolable while my milk came in. nothing worked to soothe him not shooshing, not swaddling, not anything and not even the hospital nurses could soothe him.  this was a godsend! it did not contribute to any breastfeeding problems and has been the best thing to calm our son.  he is now 3 months old and only wants it when is very stressed so he is not dependent upon it all the time, did not have nipple confusion and had learned to self soothe for the most part now by sucking his fingers.  it is really a great product and i recommend it to anyone wanting to use a pacifier for their baby. our son refuses to use any other brand or type but the soothie for the sucking action is calming to him like when he is feeding.
