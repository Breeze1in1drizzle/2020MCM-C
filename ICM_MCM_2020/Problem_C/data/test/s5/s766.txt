I think I should give this hairdryer a five star cuz for the price and the size, it's definitely a satisfactory for me. Would be perfect if it could bent but what the heck.<br />It does the job really good with 1200W. The nozzle of course helps a lot.<br />I got the older blue Conair travel hairdryer, can't remember the name and I liked it, but this one is way better.
