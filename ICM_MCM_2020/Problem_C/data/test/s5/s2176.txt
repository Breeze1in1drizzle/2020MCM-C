We have tried several other brands of natural pacifiers and this one is our favorite. It seems to be of the highest quality, smell the least weird (though they all smell weird when brand new), and have the best shape. In fact, this is the only one I have bought more than one of and I will continue to do so as needed. Stay away from natursutten- the nipple sticks to the outer ring making baby really frustrated when they go to put the paci in their mouth.
