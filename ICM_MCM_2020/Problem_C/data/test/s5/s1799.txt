My son loves these pacifiers and has been using them since he was about 2 weeks old (he's 5 months now).     The handle is fun for baby: I always hand him his binky so he can grab the handle first. This way, he decides whether he wants to teethe the sides or suck on the nipple.     They wash well in the dishwasher and come out pristine. The construction is sturdy and, despite dire warnings in baby books, the individual pieces will not separate and become a choking hazard, not even if you tug on them very hard, not even after 100 rounds in the dishwasher.
