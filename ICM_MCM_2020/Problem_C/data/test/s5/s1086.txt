I purchased this for a professional hair stylist with ten years experience.  This is the best dryer she's used thus far.  The price was amazing, less than half of what I almost paid locally.  Drying hair with this is much like aiming your head at a turbine engine with very high velocity constant airflow and heat, it dries hair in about 1/3 the time of others she's used.  I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
