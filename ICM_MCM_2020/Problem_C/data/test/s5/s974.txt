I have only used the diffuser and low speed setting for this but I love that it sends only cool air so I get the right type of drying power. I have been using this every other day for a couple weeks and I haven't noticed any damage to my hair. It is also consistently the same temperature so I don't get a mix of warm / cold air. The cold blast button I think still works but I'll have to read the instructions again on whether you hold it down or just push the button. If it's that you just push the button, I don't notice it getting any cooler after depressing it. Other than the mysterious button, this has been great. It's easy to hold and doesn't slip in my hands at all. The cord doesn't wrap itself up while I'm using it, which was an issue with my last blowdryer. It was constantly coiling up when I lifted it. I do not wrap the cord around the body of my tools, so this was especially annoying. This is my first diffusing hairdryer, so I cannot compare it to anything else but I will say that when its last day comes, I am happy enough to buy the same product.
