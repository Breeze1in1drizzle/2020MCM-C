My grandchildren absolutely adore their Wubbanubs.  They give the child tactile comfort, as each one is very soft and plush.  Also it gives the child something to hold onto as they utilize it.  I'd recommend all varieties of this product.  This one is a gift for Easter, but, another favorite is the giraffe.
