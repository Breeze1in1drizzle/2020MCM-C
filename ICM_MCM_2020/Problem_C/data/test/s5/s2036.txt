As a newborn he could only use a Soothie preemie paci because his mouth was small even though he was full term. By 4 & 1/2 months he needed to move to a newborn size so we decided to try a Wubbanub. He adores his monkey Wubba and it fits him way better now that he is a bigger guy. :) And best of all it is easy to find and doesn't bounce and roll when he drops it :)
