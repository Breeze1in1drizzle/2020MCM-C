I'm not sure if I had low expectations going in or what but very pleasantly surprised with the results. Not too loud, fits my head properly and will dry your hair ( obviously you're probably going to sit under there for awhile.. Took me about 2hr30mins ). Money well spent ( especially considering the $$$ spent at the salon).
