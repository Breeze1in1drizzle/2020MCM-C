I've been a stylist for 15 yrs and I can tell you nothing compares to this dryer in terms of closing the cuticle with added shine however I do recommend getting the Twin Turbo/ionic for $30 more it's worth every penny. I couldn't be more happier and it's made in Italy so the finest materials go into construction and you can feel it. The weight and the little kickback when turned on sounds crazy but this this is powerful.
