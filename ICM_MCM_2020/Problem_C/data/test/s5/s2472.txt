Very cute, it is the only pacifier that my baby would take. The only downside is that for babies too young (less than 4 months) the plush toy gets in the way of their hands and the pacifier keeps falling out of their little mouths. But once they learn how to use their hands, they start playing (chewing) with the toy. Adorable.
