I ordered this hair dryer for my sister and wasn't sure it would be a good one. It seemed cheap but I ended liking it better than mine, which cost twice as much! It's very light weight and not very loud at all. Since it isn't very loud, I didn't expect it to be very powerful but it dries my hair much faster than most hair dyers I've used. We've had it for over 6 months now and it's still working great! It's definitely a great hair dryer at a great price!
