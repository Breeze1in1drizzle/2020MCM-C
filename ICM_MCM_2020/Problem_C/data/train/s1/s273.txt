This dryer lasted a total of 3, light-duty, months before it died.  I contacted the company who said they'd bend the rules and allow me to send them $55.00 for a replacement.  They said that the vendor who sold the dryer through Amazon was not an authorized seller and they had no way of knowing the condition of the product when I received it.  So, long story short, not a good experience with T3.  It was underpowered when it was working. I don't trust a company who values customer satisfaction so little.
