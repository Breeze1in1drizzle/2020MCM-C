One of the pacifiers, the clear part that goes into the babies mouth was completely cut in two.  Missing a large chunk.  I'd return it, but what a headache.  I ripped open the packaging never thinking they would be damaged.  As a mom, I don't have time to be running to the UPS store to send this back for a replacement.
