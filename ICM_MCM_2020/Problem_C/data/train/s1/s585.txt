Arrived full of dents and broken exhaust mount. Had to have GE Repair come over and send a replacement.  Seller should have replaced unit but GE made it work out.  Oven seems like it will be okay but GE does have their problems.  Let's see if this one lasts longer than 3 years, the GE oven I replaced did not.
