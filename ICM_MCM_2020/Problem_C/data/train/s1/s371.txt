Absolutely loved it.  Until it quit working.  After six weeks the &#34;low&#34; setting was just a slight puff of wind.  The &#34;high&#34; setting then had as much power as the low setting had previously when it was working properly.  At the same time, the &#34;hot&#34; setting became so incredibly hot that the coils inside glowed bright orange.  So I started using the &#34;warm&#34; setting.  It's now completely worthless.
