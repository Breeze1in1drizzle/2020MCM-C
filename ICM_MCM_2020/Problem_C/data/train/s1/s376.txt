This was for 3 months the Best investment yet for my hair. I have used a cheaper hair dryer forever, but this was worth every penny. However it broke and will not shoot out and warm it hot air. Most disappointing product yet in Amazon I have bought because it worked for awhile so well. I have to purchase a new hair dryer...unfortunately it won't be this one again. As a woman who takes pride in her hair I need something more reliable and safe.
