I have purchased three of these hairdryers for my home and was very fond of the performance until yesterday.  One of the dryers stopped working completely, while another not in the master bathroom outlet.  I called our electrician to see if the outlet was having a problem which it was not.  While plugging in one of the dryers, a huge flame shot out of the GFI plug and burned completely through the cord.  The GFI cord did not work and there was luckily some minimal damange to the walls.  Please be careful and make sure you have a GFI outlet installed in your home where you use this product.  The electrician believed that the GFI on the hair dryer failed and the cord was risky for electrical fire.    Be careful...
