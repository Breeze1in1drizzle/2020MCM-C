I am having the same issue but the keypad goes dark as soon as you press start so the error code does not come on. Samsung would not fix this. They want me to pay for a repairman to come out here to fix. After all of the reviews you would think they would want to fix and save their reputation. I will never buy Samsung again, as I had a Tv that also had issues that they knew about and would not fix. If I pay for a repairman I might as well get a new microwave for that price and it won't be a Samsung!!!!!!
