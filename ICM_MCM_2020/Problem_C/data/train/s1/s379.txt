I know there have been a lot of positive reviews on this hairdryer but the one that I purchased just &#34;blew up&#34;.  Purchased in February of 2015 and can no longer use it in the end of May 2015 (three months).  My girlfriend and myself were using it daily for the three months but I would think it would last longer than that.  Trying to reach out to the manufacturer now to get replaced but this is a hassle that I don't want to deal with.<br /><br />If we get it replaced, I'll change my rating
