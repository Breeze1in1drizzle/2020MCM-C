Worked fine for 13 months then it stop heating food and it does not show any error messages. Searched on online for a solution to the problem and found that running the fan on high works for some people. I gave it a try and YES it does work. The only way to heat our food is by turning the fan on HIGH before setting the time and pushing the start button. Our microwave is installed under a cabinet but not above any stove or range, so steam or moisture is not the problem. I called Samsung and their only solution was for me to buy their extended warranty for $250.00 for one year. I told them No Thanks, if I'm going to spend more money on a microwave it won't be on a Sumsung.
