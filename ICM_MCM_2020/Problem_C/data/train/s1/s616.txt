I wish I could give this zero stars. Bought this last year to go with my kitchen remodel. Every appliance I own is LG, washer and dryer included. Luckily, they still work. I work ALL the time and prefer my food grilled. I rarely use the microwave. Just bought it as a just in case method of heating leftovers. My microwave died today. Just stopped heating. Everything else apparently works on it. Apparently, a faulty magnetron is a wide spread occurrence. I did a live chat with an online rep. She wanted to send me to a service tech over an hour away. I declined. I explained to her similar issues from most owners of this model and stated this should be looked at as being recalled. No way we all messed up our units. I forwarded her to the Amazon reviews. She was basically like yeah, ok, do you want me to find you a service center? At the end of our conversation, she just ended the session. I wasnt finished chatting with her. I will NEVER buy an LG appliance<br /><br />Chat log:<br />Chat Transcript<br />Time of chat: 7/2/2015 4:54:35 PM<br />Length of chat: 00:18:41<br />Your name: rafael vazquez<br />Chatted with: Michelle, Paulsen<br /><br />4:54 PM Michelle: Hello rafael vazquez.
