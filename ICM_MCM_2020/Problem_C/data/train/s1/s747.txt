My daughter had the lamb wubanub for a year and a half before we needed a replacement. We loved it, she loved it. It held up very well.<br />We purchased a new one for her and immediately noticed it looked like a different design from the old but figured it wouldn't be a big deal. We gave it to her and the very first nap the strings from one of the eyeballs pulled out making it look awful. Today when washing the sheets I found the ear that had gone quickly missing. I don't know what they did to cut costs but it shows big time in the end product. I used to tell everyone to buy these and they were my go-to baby shower gift but I can't do that now! I'm VERY disappointed.
