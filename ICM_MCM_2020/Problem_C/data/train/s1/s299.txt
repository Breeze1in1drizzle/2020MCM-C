I purchased this product about a month ago.  It had good air flow, although I had hoped for more since my travel hair dryer surpasses it in air volume.  However, I thought it was sufficient. Then it just stopped working after about 3 weeks. It was still within the time frame of being returnable, so I did return it and Amazon has refunded me.  I will not repurchase.
