My baby does not like these!! I notice he makes a lot of airy noises when trying to suck on these. He's a breastfed baby and refuses a bottle he's picky so I wanted a pacifier that was suppose to be closest to like human nipple to a baby.  After the airy noises I tied to suck on it myself to test it and same thing happened when I did it. Maybe a good pack for older babies but not for newborns with a smaller mouth probably heck I don't l u keep the airy sound at all it =gas usually. I,probably won't use these ever again... waste of my,money
