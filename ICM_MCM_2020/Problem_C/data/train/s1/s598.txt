Please, please do not buy this microwave. After just a few months it stopped heating intermittently. Then it started tripping our breaker. It only does this occasionally. I have had Samsung repair personnel out twice and they can't fix it. They now say I must have a faulty breaker. Well, we had a Kenmore microwave in the same exact spot for 9 years and it never once tripped the breaker. They have no explanation as to why it doesn't heat. They haven't fixed it, I'm worried the electrical system is faulty, and therefore a fire hazard and Samsung refuses to replace it.  The problems occur sporadically and as a repairman hasn't actually seen it malfunction they don't believe me. Do not buy this OR ANY SAMSUNG PRODUCT!!<br />The total lack of concern for their customer is shocking. My husband and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with some lackey from customer service named Landry H. and all he did was spend the entire time telling us he couldn't help us unless we agreed to a THIRD service call to see if they could catch it not working. He refused to transfer us to anyone else, or offer us any alternatives, no matter how many different things we suggested.  I will never buy a SAMSUNG product again, and to anyone reading this review, for your own sanity.....RUN.
