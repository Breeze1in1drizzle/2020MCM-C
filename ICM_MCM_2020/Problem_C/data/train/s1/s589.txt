We had the prior model of GE Cafe Microwave, which completely died after 3months.  It was like pulling teeth to get GE to do anything about it, however they finally agreed to replace it if I paid for deliverer and installation. We went two months without a microwave.  This new replacement model isn't much better.  The fake metal over the plastic handle started peeling off after a week and the display dimmed. They did replace the handle, but they said they can't do anything about this display as its not covered.<br /><br />As for using the microwave, it is a pain. There is no keypad, so you have to dial in all of the time.  Sometimes you press the dial to select something, other times you press a button.  It is not intuitive at all and is very hard to use.  I can't wait for it to completely die so I can buy a different brand.
