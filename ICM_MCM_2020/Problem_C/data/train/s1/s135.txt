I ordered this product because I heard from a number of friend how great it was. I have curly hair so I also ordered the diffuser to match it. I used it once to dry my hair, it was okay (not as I was told it would be). I then tried my diffuser, I used it 2 times. I went to pull the diffuser off to go back to the drying piece, the blow-dryer completely  fell apart. I noticed that the blow-dryer is made out of card board inside- THAT IS SO DANGEROUS!! I tried to get a refund from the 3rd party vendor and they replied by saying &#34;throw away the item, we will mail out a replacement!&#34; I wrote back and demanded my money!! I never heard back from them so AMAZON luckily refunded my money. For a dryer that is over 100$, this is ridiculous.<br /><br />My mistake was to not read the reviews. I am writing this to save people money, don't do it! I believe the blow dryer I got is a knock-off and I would hope these people selling them are caught and prosecuted.
