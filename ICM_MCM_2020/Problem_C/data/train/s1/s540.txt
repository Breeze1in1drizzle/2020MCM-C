I have had this microwave less than 2 years and I too am getting the SE error code.  It is $99 just for someone to look at it!  You can't press any of the buttons.  This obviously is a manufacturer issue if there are so many complaints about it.  Now I have to spend another $300 on a new microwave not Samsung.
