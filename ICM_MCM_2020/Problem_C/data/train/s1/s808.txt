This item was on my baby registry and a friend bought the 0-3 month SOOTHIE pacifier for me.  That's what my baby likes, so I decided to order another set.  I went back to the same page that was linked to from my registry and I again ordered the 0-3 month Soothie pacifier (Amazon even said on the page that this was a repeat order from my registry).  However, I was sent the 3+ months SUPER SOOTHIE.  I just went back to look at the page and it is definitely for the 0-3 month Soothie.  There must be something messed up with Amazon's ordering system because when I click on the link to read and write reviews, it then says 3+ months, but then when I click on the link to go back to the item page, it goes back to saying 0-3 months.  Make sure when you put this in your cart that you are ordering the correct product.  I am going to return these and then go buy the pacifiers I want from a brick and mortar store so that I know I'm getting what I want.  This was very disappointing.
