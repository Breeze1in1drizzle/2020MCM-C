We purchased this microwave in Oct 2011 and it stopped heating in June 2013.  The defective part is the magnetron.  The magnetron has a 5 year warranty but it will cost $90 and 3 days for GE to come to my home to confirm that is the problem.  Then I am told I can expect to pay another $250-$300 for the labor for them to come back out and replace the magnetron, no idea how long that will take.  Fighting with GE at the moment to have the part shipped to my local repair man who said he would replace for $99 total.  Warranty information does not say anything about it having to be replace by a GE tech.<br /><br />We bought all new GE appliances in October 2011 and so far we have had to have the fridge and now the microwave repaired in the first 2 years.  I guess we still have the range and dishwasher to look forward to fixing.<br />I thought GE was a good company but experience has cleared things up.
