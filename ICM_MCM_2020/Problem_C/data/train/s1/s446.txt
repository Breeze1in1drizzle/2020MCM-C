SO DISAPPOINTED!! Bought this July 2013 and our kitchen was not ready yet, so we didn't put it in until a few months ago and it worked fine- we probably used it only couple dozen times and my husband went to warm up our daughters food Wednesday and NOTHING! Completely &#34;dead&#34;! Will not turn on, no buttons works, etc.<br /><br />This is extremely disappointing and our warranty was up July 2014!!<br /><br />This is why you do not spend $800 on a microwave and I will NEVER purchase a SHARP product ever again!!!!!!<br /><br />Totally sad and disappointed.
