I'm only giving these 1 star due to the price. After coming across these and purchasing them, I saw them in Walgreens and the local supermarket, Publix. Both stores are usually pretty high in price when comparing to others such as Walmart or here on Amazon. Well, not this time...these are half the price at the local stores! One had the same 2 pacifiers for 5.99 and the other had them for 4.99!! CRAZY!! I will be calling Amazon next week to see what can be done about my recent purchase. I am a big Amazon fan and purchase quite a bit from them (as well as subscribe and save), so this is very disappointing.
