Paid an obscene amount of money for a 24&#34; Sharp microwave drawer. It was great for the 23 months that it worked. Died suddenly a few weeks ago (purchased February 2013). When it blew a fuse and then died I called appliance place where I had purchased it. I was told that I had to call Sharp directly. I did so. Spent 30 minutes on the phone telling my story to 4 very nice people at Sharp. They said that they would review my case and call me back in a few days. They called and said that someone from a local appliance place would come and look at it. Service men came, diagnosed the problem - something just blew up - and I was told that I would have to wait to here from Sharp. Local service person called back (very nice person) and he told me that Sharp would pay for the diagnostic visit only. If I chose to repair it, it would cost $180. I called Sharp - &#34;sorry, warranty over.&#34; We paid $900 for a microwave that lasted less than 2 years. That is what we get for spending so much money on a microwave!
