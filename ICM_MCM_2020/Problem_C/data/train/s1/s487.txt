I went to open my microwave and the handle snapped ...yup snapped off into pieces!  Frigidaire will so graciously allow me to buy a new one as their way of standing behind their product....yes so we purchase an expensive microwave that is made so cheaply that you have to replace the handle that breaks apart and they get more money-yes that does sound right doesn't it?  But they stand behind their products....So frustrating!  Unless you have money to burn on replacing parts-DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
