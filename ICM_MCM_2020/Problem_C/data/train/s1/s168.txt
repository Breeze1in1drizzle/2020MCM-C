This blow dryer doesn't have a cord retieval like ohter Andis dryers do. The cord is thin and very long. For storage after daily use I wrap the cord around the dryer or handle part. After only a few weeks I've noticed that the cord is becoming kinked. It's only a matter or time before it's shorting out.
