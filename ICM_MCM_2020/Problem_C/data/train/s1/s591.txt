I must prequalify this review with the statement of fact that we have 4 major Samsung appliances or electronic devices in our home. I have always liked Samsung.<br /><br />Bought and installed this microwave in January of 2012. It just died two days ago. Totally dead... no functionality whatsoever. No lights, no keypad, nothing but dull, silent, insolent non-function. It isn't my circuit, as my oven (also Samsung) shares the outlet and is working fine.<br /><br />I called Samsung, and since it is just out of warranty, the service call would be $125 just to look at it + parts and labor. On top of that, the first call would be the diagnosis, and the technician would not have the parts. They would have to reschedule for that.<br /><br />Since I have a toddler in the house, not having a microwave is out of the question. So the risk of a $200-$250 repair bill + 2 weeks of being out of commission basically means I have to go buy a new *&#!$ microwave.<br /><br />Argh. So irritating. DO NOT BUY.
