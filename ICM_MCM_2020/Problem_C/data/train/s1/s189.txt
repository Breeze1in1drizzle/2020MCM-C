When I touched the box I knew right then and there that something doesn't feel right. It didn't feel like a brand new box and when I opened it up my suspicion was confirmed. I have received a used or return product when I paid for a new one. The hair dryer had marks on it from previous use. I'm not happy about this.  UPDATE: I decided to use it anyways but it wouldn't even work. I tried resetting and testing it but it won't even turn on. The buttons are very cheaply made. When I moved the buttons it felt like it would fall apart. Very disappointed.
