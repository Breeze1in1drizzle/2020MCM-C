these cases are nice and pretty, but doesn't really work well.  the size of the case holds only 1 pacifier.  i'm not sure about other babies, but my son definitely needs more than 1 when we are on the go.  if it's design to hold only 1 pacifier, it is way too big.  if it's design to hold 2, it's way too small.<br /><br />the worse thing about it was that it's hard to open, which is extremely frustrated when you are out in the public, your baby's crying on the top his his lung, you know that the pacifier is just in the box, but you just can't get to it!!!!<br /><br />it's also hard to close.  you would've think just to snap it shut and that'll be the end of it?  no, i snap it close, heard to click, then the box open up again.  sometimes i had to do close it for 3 to 4 times before it stays close.
