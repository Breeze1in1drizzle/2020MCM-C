Bought a Sharp Microwave Drawer one and a half years ago. Barely used it - warming leftovers once a week and softening butter a few times. Started to make funny noises and gave off an electrical smell. Because I bought it from an American Supplier - Sharp Canada is saying I have no warranty and suggest that I send the microwave to a family member in the US to have it repaired. This is ludicrous. Sharp US says I have to deal with Sharp Canada. To get it repaired here it will cost $286. Either way it will cost a small fortune to repair.
