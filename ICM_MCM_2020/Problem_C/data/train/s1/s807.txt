The item I received is not the item I ordered.  The one pictured shows a separate syringe and separate medicine dispenser where the baby could suck as you push the medicine in OR you could just have the medicine part separate so they can just suck on it like a pacifier.  But I really wanted to be able to leave the syringe in so the medicine ONLY goes to the nipple and not the surrounding areas like other medicine dispsensers (I have the Munchkin one and meds get trapped around the rim.  The one I recieved is an all in one that I could buy at any Walmart, Target, etc.  I wanted the one pictured because it is separate and easier to dose small amounts.  The one I received is a white syringe with a clear pacifier nipple and the smallest dose amount you can dose out in it is 2.5mL.  I need one to be able to dose 1.25mL so this one is not even one I would order in the first place.  Also, the nipple part of this is HARD AS A ROCK.  No way an infant would find this appropriate to suck on and effectively get the medicine.<br /><br />SO disappointed.  I wanted the Mini Medicator pictured here and did NOT get that.
