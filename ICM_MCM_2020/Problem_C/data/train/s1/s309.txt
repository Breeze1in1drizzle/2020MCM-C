The hair dryer worked very well, until the cool shot button got stuck and now there is only cold air emitted. Next, the hair dryer kept tripping the circuit  and blowing the circuit. It's a shame since the dryer was quick. Don't buy this unless you want to replace your hair dryer in a couple of months.
