Not only did I receive the WRONG product, but it was also used when it was supposed to be NEW. I have this exact product at home, so I know what it's supposed to look like. The product that I received did not have the twist handle, and it came with 2 of the same attachments. I bought from Lucky Sales. DO NOT buy from them.<br /><br />I reordered this item from another company and still didn't get what I wanted. It's the right blow dryer, but it came with only 1 attachment. Disappointed. Guess I'll just have to order from folica.com.
