The door near the bottom handle mount suddenly cracked, causing the handle to fall off, and the front glass panel to slide down. Wow, this is the first time I've seen a microwave oven break like this, especially an expensive high end unit like this one! It appears to be a design flaw: The door hook springs feel unusually strong, resulting in some unnecessary stress on the door when closing. Still, this seems like a really silly thing for a high-end microwave oven.<br /><br />I recommend you avoid this.
