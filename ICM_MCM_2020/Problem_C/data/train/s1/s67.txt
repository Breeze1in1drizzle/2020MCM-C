We have owned three of these and none have been reliable. The first arrived with a cord that would not retract. Amazon replaced it and that one lasted one year before it failed. It sounded like broken bits of plastic were inside the fan so we stopped using it. We ordered another and it failed after 6 weeks. The fan speed on 'high' is about what you would get on 'low.'  There seems to be a quality issue here that I advise you to stay away from.
