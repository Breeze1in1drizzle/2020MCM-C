When I received this dryer I found it a little heavy and the air flow was too strong. Also the buttons are in a weird location  but since it was the second dryer I ordered from Amazon I decided to keep it. Big mistake! Last week it started to eat my hair. I have long hair and the exhaust end of the dryer grabs my hair and rips it off my head. I don't know why this started after a month but now it is too late to return it. Doesn't matter, I won't use it again.
