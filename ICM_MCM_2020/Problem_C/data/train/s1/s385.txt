Bought the Sharp R-1874 in November 2006 and immediately noticed that the entire unit appeared to be of flimsy construction.  Now the door will not seal properly and it will only work in the micro or convection mode if the user continually keeps pressure on the latch.  A ridiculous situation.     Sharp USA was no help and a repairman gave me a $230 quote to fix it.
