We loved the small size & appearance.  Unfortunately, it worked for the first 3 days, so we through away the box.  Before the week was over, it wouldn't heat anything no matter how long we set the timer for, or what power setting we used.  Without the box, it can't be returned. A complete waste of money.  DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE, or if you feel like gambling, at least SAVE THE BOX!
