I so wanted this small microwave to work.  My plates fit, a small cup fits, but my normal coffee mug is too tall.  The inside is only 5.5 inches high from the rotating plate, not 6-3/4&#34; as the website describes.  So my 6&#34; coffee mug doesn't fit.  Returned.<br />If Whirlpool would make the same mike to hold 12&#34; plates and a 7&#34; mug, I would buy that.  A little more power would be nice too.
