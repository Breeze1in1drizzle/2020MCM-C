Shipment was missing a piece. It took forever for them to figure out what piece i was missing. Repeatedly asked them to overnight the missing piece because i was going out of town. Apparently they overlooked that part of the email. Hopefully they sent the right piece. This review is based on the customer service, not on whether the product works well.
