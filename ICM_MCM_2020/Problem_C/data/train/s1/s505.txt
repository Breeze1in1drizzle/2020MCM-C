Bought GE's 2006 model. It became a bread box/clock four days ago (about 9/15/2012). Scheduled one of their authorized repair men. Took him 5 minutes to determine that the only problem was that the microwave generator thingy quit. The display, oven light and turntable are as good as new, but the micro doesn't heat anything. Cost of the part = $400. The good news is that the $75 house call will be offset by getting a coupon redeemable for $100 if I buy another GE Profile over-the-range. My cheap, little, off brand counter top microwave just won't quit working. I'm not certain what to do.<br /><br />One last thing, the halogen surface light quit about six weeks after original purchase. You have to stand on your head, and use a special backhanded screw driver to replace the bulbs. Very convenient feature, but maybe I should have paid an authorized repair tech to replace the bulbs.
