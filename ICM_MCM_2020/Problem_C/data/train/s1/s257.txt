I tried to replace my old Conair Dual Voltage Travel Smart hairdryer.  Unfortunately this one was not very much like the old one.  This one is bigger and bulker, weighs quite a bit more, does not come with a carrying case, and does not have a built-in loop with which to hang from a hook. Also, it is supposed to be two speed, but the low speed is too weak and delivers a stream of coolish air.  The high speed is too powerful and delivers an excessively hot stream of air.<br />What a disappointment!!!
