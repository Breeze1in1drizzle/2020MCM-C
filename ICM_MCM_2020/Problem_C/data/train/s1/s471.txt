Oh my goodness, I can't believe how horrible this microwave is. All this material used to construct something that is just going to clog up the landfill.<br /><br />Here's our story.  Back in April of this year (2014) our old microwave died. We needed a replacement right away because that's how our household rolls.  I eat popcorn, we microwave veggies.... So, hub and I rushed over to HomeDepot to get a replacement. This GE microwave looked nice. We bought it. We also, thankfully, purchased an insurance policy.<br /><br />Well, 2 weeks ago in May this General Electric microwave died. No electrical response at all. Took it back to HD and they replaced it with another.<br /><br />We assumed it was a fluke. That we just got a bad one. A lemon. NOPE. The second microwave died last night. Same symptoms. No warning. Just died.<br /><br />We are returning this General Electric microwave today. HomeDepot will give us another. However, we are also going to buy another microwave because we know this new GE piece of junk might not last out the week. With another microwave in the house we at least won't have to rush out to acquire another one.<br /><br />Don't buy GE. They might have made good equipment in the past but it's obvious that they are living off their reputation and that they don't have any quality control in their manufacturing process.
