I would expect a coil cord to re-coil.  This does not.  It stretched and re-coiled about 50% on the first try. I did not over do it.  I went about 3 feet at most. I can tell by closer examination that it would only get more stretched. What is the point of a coiled cord.  I could simply use a regular dryer with a hook.  I had not mounted it but had one person hold it against the wall for placement evaluation...not to test the cord.  I am returning this defective product.
