I have worked in a daycare for over 4 years now in the infant room. We had one child who used this binky and it was awful. Firstly, it was too difficult for the child to hold the binky in his/her mouth due to how heavy it is. Secondly, it is difficult to clean. Usually, we would run the binkies through the sanitizer, but this left the stuffed animal part soggy. Now the child is over three years old and still uses these binkies. The child's teeth are pushed outward so much that it is difficult for the child to speak. It makes me sad that this small item caused so much damage.
