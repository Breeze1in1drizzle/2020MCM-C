I believe the 5 star reviews are fake.  This is an awful product.  It's very hard to open and shut and the best I can do it *sort of* get it on and twisted a little bit, which isn't totally locked and therefore I can't use the plastic cap for travel since it has to be fully locked for the lid to snap on properly  The opening to the mesh is too small for a 2 inch piece of banana.  And the reviews that said it was easy to clean?  Totally fake.  It's a nightmare to clean. Yes you can take the pieces apart but getting banana out of the mesh is most certainly not easy.  You have to hand pick each little bit out of the net.  I would send this back, but I only paid a few dollars and it's not worth my hassle.  I can't compare this to other mesh feeders, as this is my first.  Surely they can't get worse!
