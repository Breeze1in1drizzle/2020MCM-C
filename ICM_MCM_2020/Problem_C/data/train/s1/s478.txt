Amazing that such a reputable company would put out such a poorly thought out product.<br /><br />Everyone should know by now that the most important part of a microwave oven is the user interface.  Afterall, a microwave oven has one power setting that must be somehow regulated by an on/off switch  - so I am amazed that Frigidaire could mess that up so.<br /><br />For instance:  when it is done cooking - the 3 loud beeps go off VERY SLOWLY.  During which time it is impossible to add time, or even to stop the beeping.  You can open the door, but it still beeps;  you can not push the stop button, because until the beep is done - NOTHING ELSE WORKS -  This thing is robbing my time a few seconds at a time.<br /><br />Who is the Frigidaire executive that pushed this forward with out simple end user testing?<br /><br />Skip it... Underpowered for it's size and frustrating to use.
