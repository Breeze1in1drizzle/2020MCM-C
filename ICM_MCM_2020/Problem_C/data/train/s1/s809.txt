My baby only takes these soothie for 0-3months. Now that she is 7 months and she's got one tooth out, we purchased this. My baby doesn't take it at all. And it keeps coming off her mouth. I think it is much more harder for her to suck. I understand why the material has got to be harder and thicker for older babies but if they don't take it at all, what is the point at all?
