We just purchased a brand new home towards the end of April 2013 which had this microwave installed. There was no power in the house until we purchased it and we have already had the SE error code twice now. Even though the item was never used prior to April it is considered out of warranty because it was purchased in 2011. One of the reasons we picked this house was because of the brand new appliances. Samsung really blew it on this one. When we finally get the $$$ to replace this it will be with Frigidaire.  At least those still work in my home...
