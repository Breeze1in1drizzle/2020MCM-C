I know you get what you pay for, in most cases, but in this case, I don't feel I did. I expected it to take longer to heat than my old 1000 watt, but it takes at least twice as long. The turn table rattles, and because of it's light weight, you have to hold it with your left hand while pushing the button to open the door with your right, otherwise you will push it across the counter. Very displeased.
