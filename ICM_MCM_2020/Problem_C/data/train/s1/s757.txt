I bought these in green, blue, and yellow. They were all fine except that the green ones said 3m+, all the others were 0-3m. My (8m old) son HATES them! He thinks he's being tricked. He looks at them, sucks once or twice, gets angry and throws them. I wish I hadn't tossed the package because even though they're only $3 I would have sent them back.<br /><br />If your baby is a fan of the soft, squishy 0-3m pacifiers then they won't like these. The 3m+ ones are very hard, they're a bit more firm than the Gumdrop ones he also dislikes.
