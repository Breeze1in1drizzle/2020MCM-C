there are many reasons why we enjoyed this product in the short term, and one *very* important reason why we don't in the long-term.  the negative, which is a big safety issue, needs to come first:  the feet of the wubbanub are weighted with bean-bag beans.  our (still quite young) baby loves to chew on all parts of the animal, not just the paci, and the seams are *not* tightly sewn: two feet have opened up.  as another poster noted, the beans are contained within a mesh compartment inside the animal feet, but get through the plush and you're right up next to that.  i've sewed up one of the frayed feet, but there is little fabric at the seam to allow safe or easy repair.  particularly now that our baby has the beginnings of two teeth (which, i might add, came after the seams sprang, not before), i am reluctant to leave the wubbanub alone with her in her swing or car seat lest she gnaw into the beans by mistake, which could be disastrous.  we're going to have to retire this toy.  the obvious safety issues at stake here make any follow-up comments superfluous--it's non-negotiable in my book.  but i will allow that this is disappointing because our baby loved her wubbanub, and spent a lot of time learning to manipulate it.  it was her very first toy in terms of something she interacted with, and i think it actually helped her development in a number of ways.  she'd probably like to keep it around for a while, but i just can't do it on these terms.  i hope a redesign might come up with some other way of weighting the feet.
