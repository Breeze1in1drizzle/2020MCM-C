I love the concept of this. I got one for my baby shower the green version. Well, unfortunately when I took it out of the package the pacifier thermometer didn't work. It would beep but it wouldn't take a temperature or show anything on the screen. Also, I do not recommend using the pacifier medicine dispenser on any child under 6 months maybe more than that.The reason being because the hole is very large and even though it contains the medicine when you suck it out basically all the medicine comes out so it's about as useful as using a spoon. It sucks I wasn't able to use the thermometer part I was looking forward to it being easier. However, I do not recommend this product. Why waste your money when you can get a regular thermometer for $3 or less.
