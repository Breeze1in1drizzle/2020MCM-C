I had high hopes that my daughter was going to latch on this product thinking it is the same product produced by Hawaii Medical... Turns out it is not, as I clearly see now by Tomy.<br /><br />It did work for my baby! Cute colors but I must say for a breastfed baby it is too glossy abit hard and very fake!
