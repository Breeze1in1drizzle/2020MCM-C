$13 for a pacifier attached to a toy that I cannot remove and replace? ARE THEY NUTS?!! Anyone who would buy this has sucker written all over them! I used binky clips for all four of my kids and never had a problem with them. It made it easy to find it at night too. If your newborn baby is waking up every couple of hours searching for a nipple, they're probably hungry. Feed them instead of shoving a paci in their mouth! All of my newborns ate every couple of hours...they have tiny stomachs. I simply fail to see how this is not a suffocation hazard! They always says to keep blankets & stuffed animals away from babies faces!
