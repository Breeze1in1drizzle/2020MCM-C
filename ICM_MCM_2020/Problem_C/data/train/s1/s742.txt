I was SO disappointed with this product. I hadn't considered it would have been made with such low quality- especially for the price. I honestly thought it was a joke. I received a plush toy that resembles something that would come with a child's fast food meal only with a pacifier sewed into it's mouth. This product makes sanitizing the pacifier a chore and washing the plush toy separately impossible. If considering purchasing this product I suggest making your own- find a low quality stuffed animal around the size of your hand and sew a binky into it's mouth.
