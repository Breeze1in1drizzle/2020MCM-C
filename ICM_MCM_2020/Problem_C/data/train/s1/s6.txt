I was looking for something inexpensive for our vacation home so we could put in all the bathrooms.  Bought 3 of these and very happy, works better than the more expensive ones.  Have not had any problems thus far and works great.<br /><br />Edit:  Dropped this to one star.  In a year 2 out of the 3 I have bought failed.  One sounds like a bearing failing and the other won't get hot anymore.  Basically they are cheap for a reason.  One that failed, even thought a year old, was only used maybe 10 times.
