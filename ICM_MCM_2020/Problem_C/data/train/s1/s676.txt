I thought this product would be great for my 14 month old when I saw another mom had it, so I went out and bougght 5 of them with high hopes.<br /><br />However, within 3 hours my son got injured in his lip when he fell with the Keep-It-Kleen pacifier and began to bleed rapidly with a pool of blood beside him.  It was very scary!!!  I almosty went to the emergency room, but managed to get the blleding to stop after ten minutes or so...<br /><br />Your child will likely fall down and some point while walking, etc. and if they have the pacifier in their mouth it may cause some extensive damage to the upper, lower lip internally or externally.<br /><br />I contacted the company and they were suppose to send me some information in the mail and to no avail have I received anything from them.<br /><br />Not impressed with the level of concern and curious how many other children will be injured and tramatized from this...<br /><br />Regards,<br />Concerned Mom
