Just like with the previous reviewer, this microwave worked well until it didn't work at all.  It started turning itself on and then the keypad stopped working.  Since we had bought the house with the microwave, we didn't have the  info we needed to return it but on the instruction manual, the previous owner wrote that it was installed in 2008 and the oven stopped working at the end of 2009.  The manufacture date on the unit said December 2007 so it was less than 2 years old.
