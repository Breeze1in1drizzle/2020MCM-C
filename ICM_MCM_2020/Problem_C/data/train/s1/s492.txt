fridgidaire over the range (fmv 156 dca) looks nice but nothing but trouble.  First the handle broke. I fixed it. Then the diode/rectifire failed--i replaced that and the magnitron, worked for a year than died in the middle of cooking a baked potatoe. Replaced diode--still not working. I am giving up and never buying fridigaire again.  BTW i replaced it with a maytag--what do you know, as soon as i tried to cook some popcorn it shut off. It only will stay on for 10 seconds or so before shutting off. I am taking it back and am wondering how much bad luck can one have--or is this all a conspiracy to keep microwave service people busy.
