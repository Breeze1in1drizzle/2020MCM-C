Warning: Stay away from this microwave.  It looks pretty, but it will cost you.  Read the other reviews about its unreliability, GE's poor service, and the expense of repairing this product.  I should have done that before we purchased ours.  If your product is still under the one-year warranty, maybe you have a shot at breaking even.  Ours stopped working just a few months after the 12-month warranty expired.  If you're not under warranty, this is an appliance nightmare, which begins with a $99 service charge so the GE authorized repairman can tell you how much it will actually cost you to repair the microwave (parts and labor).  Not sure how you can ever cost-justify repairing one of these.  Update: GE told us it was not cost effective to repair the unit, but they did offer a $200 rebate toward another GE microwave.  Still can't recommend the unit.
