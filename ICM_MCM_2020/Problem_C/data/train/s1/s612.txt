We used this brand new microwave for 3 weeks, and last night it caught fire while we were microwaving food.<br /><br />The food was not burnt, or overcooked. In fact it still had a minute more to go, when I noticed flames inside, at the top fan assembly region. We were able to put it out with a damp towel, but the entire top section was melted to reveal the electrical wiring inside.<br /><br />We googled to see if anyone had a similar problem and found the review posted just a week earlier hear on Amazon. This is clearly not some random freak accident, but a recurring problem with this microwave.<br /><br />If you have this microwave, do not leave it unattended while microwaving. If you are considering purchasing it, please please do not do it.
