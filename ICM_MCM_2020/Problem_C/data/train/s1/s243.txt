The hair brush and combs fall off when you use them.The hairdryer specification say it three speed but fails to mention it only works on one speed and one heat setting if used at the 240 voltage!!!!!<br />I feel that the seller fails to mention the limitations... who buys a one speed one heat hair dryer?
