We purchased a home in 2013 with this already installed.  The original owners had to get it repaired once.  Since it doesn't have a turn table, it does not heat food evenly and it creates hot spots on dishes.  I have broken 3 very expensive hand made dinner plates due to the hot spots on the stoneware.  I've had the plates for 15 years with no issues.  I did buy a $30 turntable from amazon to help, but this microwave is not worth it.  We still use our old sharp countertop convention microwave and prefer it over this one.  Also, sometimes you have to let the drawer open all the way before you can shut it, which can be annoying.
