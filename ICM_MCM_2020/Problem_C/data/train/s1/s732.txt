I found this dispenser at a local store and bought it since it was the only medicine dispenser designed for infants that wasn't sold in a baby kit.  I needed it because my son (who is only 2 months old) is on multiple liquid medicines daily (and multiple times a day at that) for a few medical conditions.  He was gagging on the meds when given through a syringe and I decided he needed a better way to take the meds.  I wish I had never spent the money on this product.      Safety 1st made a horrible mistake with this product.  First off, it is nearly impossible to open this dispenser to get the medicine into it.  Even my husband had difficulty trying to separate the medicine holder section from the pacifier nipple section.  Second, the medicine started leaking out from the rim as soon as we inverted the product.  Third, the nipple section of this is a very hard plastic material that is also very large.  It is nothing like any pacifier I have ever seen a child use.      I would not recommend this product at all.  I would, however, recommend the [[ASIN:B002RJKH4G Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Bottle Medicine Dispenser]] as it does the job perfectly!
