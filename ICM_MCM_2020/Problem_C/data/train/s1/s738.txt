My daughter loves these pacifiers but I am going to have to get rid of them. She was dozing happily and screaming the next moment. I rushed over to see what was wrong and found her finger wedged in one of the four holes! I had to pry it off her finger was jammed in there so tight! Her finger was bright red and she was upset for ages. What kind of a design is that!? They know babies with little fingers will be touching the pacifier... So they put baby finger traps on the pacifier?! Awful!<br /><br />Also as others have said, water from washing gets trapped inside the nipple, creating a bacteria risk.
