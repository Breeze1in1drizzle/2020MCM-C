I was just heating my lunch and once the cycle ended (fan, light and turn table turned off) the heating keep going. The only way to make it stop is to unplug. Seems like many people are having the same issue after just a couple years. I just read on the forums that  the control board is the issue which costs around $160. Piece of crap. Poor design, and also the timer is useless and other featured that are annoying. Stay away from this product.
