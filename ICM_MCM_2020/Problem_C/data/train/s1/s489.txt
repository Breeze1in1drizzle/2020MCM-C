I have a Frigidaire microwave model CFMV 164LS, a former version of this model installed in my RV.  It quit working after 3 months of use.  After weeks of trying to get it replaced under warranty, Frigidaire has finally found someone to do the replacement with this model but Frigidaire has now refused to pay the service fee for doing the replacement where the unit is located.
