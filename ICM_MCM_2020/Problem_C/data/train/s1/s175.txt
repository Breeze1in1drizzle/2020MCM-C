When the product arrived the back peice was open but I popped it back on. It works good to dry hair like in the salon. However after about 4 uses, yes four,4, it started smoking from the back and never came back on. There was no warranty info in the box. Ive contacted the seller so I guess ill see what happens. Its been basically a month of owning this crap and it doesnt work anymore. Total waste of my money. Im very upset.
