This is a basic somewhat compact blow dryer that worked well in the beginning. As described it has two blower speeds and two heat settings and that's it. The cord is a decent length without being too long or too short. If anything the high speed blower setting might be too fast, but it's not a big problem. However, I have had three of these , so read the updates.  Update#1: After  3 months the first one is still blowing and going. Came back and ordered another. Nothing but good things to say about this little hair dryer.  Update# 2: June 17, 2013: The first of two dryers I bought like this one stopped working today. It lasted about 10 months before the off/on switch smoked and went limp. It flops back and forth completely useless. Not as much of a bargain as I thought at first. But, I am ordering another and writing this bad switch off as bad luck. My 3rd one is on the way.  Update #3: In less than 4 months the second hair dryer quit. That is 2 of the three we own. I am not buying a fourth one.  Update #4: The third dryer has quit. Not one of the three lasted more than 10 months. It is not worth the hassle to return these cheap hair dryers. The cost of shipping both ways is more than buying a new one. Three hairdryers in just over a year all bought here on Amazon. The one I used the longest lasted 10 months. Andis is not a quality hair dryer in fact to me it is the definition of &#34;too cheap to be true&#34; junk.
