BUYER BEWARE...... I purchased this March 2014 & originally gave it 5 stars review; however, in less than 4 months the fan in the unit broke into many pieces causing the dryer to almost catch fire.  I reached out to the seller but received no response.  I had purchased this one because I had had a wall mount similar that lasted for years.  I have since ordered a Conair from someone else.
