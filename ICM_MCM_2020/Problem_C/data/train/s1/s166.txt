Hairdryer is not as quiet as claimed, easy to handle, buttons seem to be in the wrong place, since I continually turn dryer off accidentally while attempting to dry hair.  Drying capabilities are good, I would give the item no more than a C-- have definitely had better hairdryers.  Will most likely purchase another-- much quieter one and keep this as a back up!<br />Not recommended if someone is concerned about noise levels.
