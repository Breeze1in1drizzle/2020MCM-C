I ordered this item as a birthday gift for my wife 3 weeks in advance. I never received the product, but did get a email with a gift certificate for $0.00. I spoke with the vendor twice, once on the phone and once via chat. Both times the conversations were hard to understand and confusing.<br /><br />Stay away from this vendor. You can get this item at KMart for $14.99 (but shipping was $6.95...pick up at store is $0).
