After about a year this hair dryer started making a buzzing sound.  When I disassembled it, I could see that the blades were breaking allowing the blades to rub against the housing causing the buzzing sound.  Had I not seen this, the blades would have eventually broken off and fired out at the user.  There has been no recall so all the products are suspect.  Do not buy this product.
