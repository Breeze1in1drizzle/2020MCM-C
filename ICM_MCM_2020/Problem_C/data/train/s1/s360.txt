I made a huge mistake by not returning this hair dryer immediately.  The reviews were all terrific, so I just assumed I was not adjusting the ion settings correctly.  My hair is somewhat curly and I usually blow it straight, although sometimes I diffuse it curly.  This hair dryer has, without exception, left my hair extremely unruly.  It makes my hair appear very dry and unhealthy.  I have used some excellent ionic hair dryers in the past and kept waiting for this one to work as well.  Big mistake.  The high heat is extremely hot and damaging to hair.  The medium heat just doesn't seem to create any smoothness and there is no cooling button.  One must keep switching the heat settings constantly while trying to dry your hair.  I've been trying to contact the seller, but have been unsuccessful.  I'd love to know if there is some trick that I haven't discovered!
