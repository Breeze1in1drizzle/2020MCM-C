if you pull the nipple all the way to the sides, out will come a collection of 'things' from hair to lint to dry milk...one day while cleaning one of the pacifiers I noticed a piece of hair stuck to the base of the nipple, when I pulled the nipple to the side, the hair still wouldn't come off, so I pulled it really hard and along with the hair came a string of lint...I did the same thing to the other 3 pacifiers and found them dirty as well...since then I kept an eye on these nipples and noticed that even within a few hours of use, it still collected lint and other things...... I regularly would boil the pacifiers and wash around the base of the nipple, but this isn't enough for these pacifiers...I am sending these nipples back to the company for my $$ back...don't buy these unless you are willing to constantly keep washing them within a few hours throughout the day...
