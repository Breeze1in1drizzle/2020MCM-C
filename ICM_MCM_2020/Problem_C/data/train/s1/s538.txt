This was bought as part of a package of kitchen equipment in May 2013.<br /><br />Currently it hasn't worked for 1/4 of the time I have owned it.<br /><br />As other reviewers have identified there is a known issue where they stop working and don't response at all - Samsung executive customer service refuses to do anything outside the attempt to 'repair it 3 times process'.<br /><br />There is nothing good to say about Samsung, their product, their staff or their agencies - to continue to sell a product that is known to be deficient is negligent<br /><br />I own other Samsung products but because of this I will never buy one again and make sure I can influence others to do likewise.<br /><br />Please don't buy this product - it will most likely fail and you will wish you hadn't...<br /><br />I certainly regret it
