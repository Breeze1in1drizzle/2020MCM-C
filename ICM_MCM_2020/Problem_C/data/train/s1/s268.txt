This dryer can't compare at all to past hair dryers.  It is hard to adjust and very noisy.  It took me a few attempts to finally find a way to sit under this dryer without it knocking out my rollers or making me sit in very uncomfortable positions.  Hard to adjust on my own, had to have my husband fix it for me.
