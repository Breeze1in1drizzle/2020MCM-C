Warning! This dryer will catch on fire! I was excited about this dryer because it was cheap, included the accessories I needed and looked to be good quality from the description and reviews, but I guess not! I just received it today and tried it out this evening to dry my hair. Started it out on low/warm for a few minutes to make sure it worked properly. It was fine so I moved it up to high/warm and continued. I used it for a minute before I heard crackling sounds from inside and looked in, the coils inside were turning red hot so I turned it off. About a minute later I turned it back on low to see if it was a fluke, the dryer started to hum quietly (not at the speed/sound it was just at when working properly) and then caught on fire! Smoke coming out of both ends, inside red hot and small flames. Needless to say it is unusable and I will be returning for a refund. I had it less than 24 hours and literally one use and it is gone. Do not buy. I was fooled by the good reviews, maybe I received a defective product but I will not be trying again.
