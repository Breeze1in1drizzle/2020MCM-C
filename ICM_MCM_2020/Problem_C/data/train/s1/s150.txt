I bought this dryer at Amazon in order to get it for $125 less than the MSR.  In 6 months it quit working completely and I contacted Amazon about it only to be told that it was past the 30 days.  I emailed Amazon a few time before posting this, in order to give then a chance to make it right, but they offer no help at all.  This is when I learned that these hair dryers are ONLY sold through authorized dealers and Amazon is not one of them.  So my hair dryer is possibly a copy; it is certainly not under any kind of warranty and I just lost that $175.  The real deal is a fabulous dryer and I would suggest buying it for the full $300 and having a 4-year warranty on it.      Amazon is one of the places online that I have always felt safe making purchases, but no more.  Please be aware that you're taking a chance that it may not be authentic and it might fail, and, if it does, you will have just lost a lot of money because there is no support for it.
