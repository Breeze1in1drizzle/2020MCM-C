I have bought lots of the Wubbanub pacifiers, but on a recent Amazon purchase, I decided to buy ones that are called Wubbanub, but by a different manufacturer; Mary Meyer. It came, I washed it (like all others) and it fell apart when I pulled it out of the washing machine. This has never happened with the real Wubbanubs, so be cautious and buy the original.
