I have owned a suite of Ge Cafe products  ( i.e. refrigerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher ) for approximately 6 years now. My recommendation is stay away. My refrigerator has seen a visit from the repairman four times. My stoves plastic knobs melted off and I was kindly advised by GE that I could now buy new metal ones for $300. My dishwashers dispenser in not dispensing. And now to round things off my microwave's touchpad is not functioning as it should. GE is comping me the parts which the repairman quoted me $1,225.00 and labor at $100.00(my responsibility). I read from other poster's comments that this issue will happen again. I contacted GE, advised them of the cost ,and suggested that I apply my labor cost towards the purchase of a new microwave. I was shot down. New microwave  $750.00 vs paying $1225 for parts??? If I were a  GE shareholder I would be outraged at this type of irresponsible spending. Multiply this type of activity several thousand times over and you're talking serious money. Quality has seriously gone down since the days my parents bought GE products. They have lost a future customer in me and my family. If you're considering this line of products buyers beware.
