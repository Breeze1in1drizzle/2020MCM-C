We understand that the listing specifies colors vary but we thought they'd at least be neutral colors.  We received two hot pink pacifiers for a boy.  It really isn't that hard to create multiple listings for the various colors.  Shame on us for believing that the colors shown might be the colors delivered.  Do not buy from seller until they fix the listings.
