I ordered this conair hairdryer to replace a different model conair hairdryer that was great but had stopped working after 3 years of heavy use.  From the first time I used this model I found the airflow to be weak.  After using it twice, the words next to the settings had smeared and are now almost completely rubbed off.    Do not buy this model.
