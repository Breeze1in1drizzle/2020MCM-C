It was ok. Convection and bake worked OK. A lot of buttons to push just to get it to go. Usually I hit the 30 second button and then turned the knob. Also cannot see non illuminated buttons in a semi- dark corner of kitchen. However, the unit stopped working after 17 months. Just passed the warranty. Not happy.
