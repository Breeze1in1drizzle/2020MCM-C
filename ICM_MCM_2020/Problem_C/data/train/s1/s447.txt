Had the same issue as Trina on reviews. I purchased via the USA and had shipped to Canada via a freind. Manufactured Oct 2013 and used 5 times before it died. Sharp basically told me to take a hike because of no cross border warranty. My kitchen reno is not even done and this thing has already failed and cost me $250 to have fixed. garbage product, garage service, garabge company. Stay away !!!
