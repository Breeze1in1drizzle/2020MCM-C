Even though I paid more for this dryer than others I've owned, it died suddenly after just 10 months even though I only used it 2-3 times/week. When it did work, the long cord got terribly tangled and was a pain, so be sure you want that if you buy this. But my advice is to buy a different brand. I've bought many brands of hair dryers over the years and never had one die after less than 2 years use! Theoretically this was still under warranty, but it didn't seem worth the hassle to replace it (esp as I didn't want another one) so I chalked it up to experience and bought a Conair for less $.
