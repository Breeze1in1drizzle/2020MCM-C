This dryer features a retractable cord. First time used, cord did not retract, and dryer was very heavy. Switch for heat control and on and off is supposed to slide up and down, but is hard to operate - does not move easily. and worst of all, didn't dry hair as well as the old conair I had.<br />Next!
