Honestly, the manufacturer says that this sterilizes pacifiers, but I have a very hard time believing them.  Now, I've not done any scientific tests, but this thing is very cheap looking/feeling plastic, takes a few AAA batteries and when you press it down (sometimes) a very ordinary light comes on and then switches off after awhile. Again, it may work, but if I had to bet whether it did or didn't, I would whole heartedly bet on that it didn't. The manufacturers might do well to either make the light brighter or make the thing hum or vibrate so it looks like it is doing something, but no - a normal light comes on and then it goes off and miraculously the pacifier that just fell on the floor is supposed to be sterile? I don't know.<br /><br />I do know that if it has snot on it or small pieces of dust or dirt, they don't fall off. They don't look different after going into this gadget, so I would save myself the money and buy some wipes that will at least get the junk off of a pacifier that falls on the ground or your kid has been sucking on forever, because at least it cleans it off.  It is up to you to decide whether to believe this cheap feeling imported machine actually sterilizes, but if you're a skeptic like me, save your money.
