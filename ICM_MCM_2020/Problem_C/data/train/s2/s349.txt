My baby is 3 months old. She has 3 Wubs, and the striped cat and the purple bunny are GREAT. However, the pacifier on the caterpillar is too floppy and it doesn't stay in her mouth the way the others do, and there is no chance of my baby being able to get it back in her mouth if it falls out. I really, really like the other two she has. I thought this one would be fun for her because of the textures and legs, but she just doesn't like it. I will keep trying it, because it may be better when she is a little older and her motor skills develop more.
