I bought this hair dryer having read the wonderful reviews.  It took forever to come and then didn't live up to expectation.  I was hoping to solve my frizz problem and speed up the drying time, but I didn't think this hair dryer did either.  I sent it back and was pretty annoyed that they only refunded me $64 of the $88 I spent on it.  They charged me a restocking fee and a shipping fee when I already paid $11 to send it back myself.  All in all, a lousy deal.
