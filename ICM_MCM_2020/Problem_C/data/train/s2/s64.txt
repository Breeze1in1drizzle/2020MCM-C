I purchased this as a Christmas present and how embarrassing was it when the person I purchased it for said, well, I loved it until I used it the third time and when I went to take off the concentrator the whole front of the blow dryer fell apart. I guess we'll see how highly rated this seller really is. He hasn't responded to my email still!
