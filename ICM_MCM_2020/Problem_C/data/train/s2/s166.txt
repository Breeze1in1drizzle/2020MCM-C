I ordered this because I was looking for something to speed up the drying process for my long hair and decided to try this one based on the fast dry ionic feature.  The product dries my hair OK but I can't see any difference in the time it takes compared to my old blow dryer.  The things I don't like about it are:<br />1.  It's really big.  I had to reorganize my bathroom because it wouldn't fit in the drawer my old blow dryer occupied.<br />2.  It's really big (again) - I have small hands so it's uncomfortable and unwieldy to hold and operate.  One small plus is that, although it's huge it's thankfully not very heavy.<br />3.  Watch out for the buttons!  They are placed on the handle in a way that allows you to accidentally turn the hair dryer off, change the drying speed or the temperature while you are trying to dry your hair.  Since this just happened AGAIN to me I decided to write this review!  It's uncomfortable to try and hold a huge hair dryer while having to constantly watch the position of your hand on the handle where the buttons are located so as not to change a setting while operating.<br />I'll keep this because it's easier than returning it but if I had it to do over again I would not purchase this particular hair dryer.
