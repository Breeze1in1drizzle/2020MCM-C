There is not enough shape to the nipple part.  Combined with the heaviness of the plastic, baby can't latch on to it, and if she does - it falls right out because of the weight.  I would have expected much better for the price.  I use only MAM now, but I can imagine just about any other pacifier would be better than these.  I gave an extra star because they do seem made well, but functionally, these are only a 1 star.
