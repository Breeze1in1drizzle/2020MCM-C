I believed the wonderful hype about this dryer. Still, there was one nagging review that said the hair dryer was breaking her hair. I ignored it. I hope you won't.    The dryer seemed to make my hair dull. I could live with that. But I started to watch my hair get frizzy. I have wavy hair, and I live in a dry climate; no reason for frizz. But it wasn't actually frizzy - it was actually all the broken ends frying into frizzle. I finally had to admit that the dryer was the problem and I went back to my nearly broken old dryer from 1995.     It will take a long time before my hair is grown out and the damage gone. Lots of nourishing hair products and lots of time. And I wasted so much money on a dryer that really hurt my hair. Too late for me, but if you haven't bought it yet, don't do it.
