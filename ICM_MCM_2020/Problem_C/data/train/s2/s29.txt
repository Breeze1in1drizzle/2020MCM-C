I liked this hair dryer while it worked. It was light and didn't tire my arm or wrist, it got hot enough to dry my hair, and it wasn't extremely loud like a lot of dryers are. However, after a month and a half of using it once every day for about 15 mins, it stopped blowing hot air. It still blew air and everything perfectly, it just stopped heating the air. So, I had to get rid of it because cold air does not work well to dry my long hair. I think it might have just been a lemon, because I know sometimes there's just going to be defective items in a group. Amazon customer service was quick to help me though, and I was able to get a refund.
