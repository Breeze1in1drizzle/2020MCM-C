This is one of those tings new mommies look at and wonder, How did my parents ever survive without one of those? Then you buy it and you quickly learn it's because it's completely useless. I ended up keeping the binky on a clip that hooked to the baby's clothes whenever we went out. This kept it from falling, and also made it unnecessary for me to use a bag at all. If I needed to put it away, I just threw it in the diaper bag (which is clean, and I'm not a germaphobe).<br /><br />Also, the snap on the loop always came open, so I couldn't trust it on the diaper bag strap. That's the whole reason I thought it'd be cool...so I didn't have to dig through the diaper bag for the binky. But I ended up having to keep it in the bag anyway because it would just fall off.<br /><br />Now my older son thinks it's a cute purse and shoves little things in it.
