My husband bought the 0-3 size for our one month old son hoping to replace the Playtex Ortho-Pro pacifier, but they made contact with his nose (but his airway was clear) and left a horrible rash on his cheeks after he fell asleep with it in his mouth for about an hour.  The rash was so bad that the pediatrician recommended the use of 1% hydrocortisone cream during his check up.      I did give the item 2 stars because they had little individual covers for each pacifier to keep the pacifier clean when not in use.
