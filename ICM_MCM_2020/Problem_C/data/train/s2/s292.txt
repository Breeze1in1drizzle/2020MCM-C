My son isn't really into pacifiers, but  my husband bought these hearing all the rave from them from his co-workers. My son can not keep these in his mouth. He chooses to spit them out, and prefers the cheaper Gerber ones or Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone Pacifier. He is strictly breastfed for the last 4 months, and still would rather have the Gerber rather than these. I think he does prefer the Soothie bottles when I do pump and will be doing more often since I start working soon. He really does love the Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone Pacifier and I would definitely recomend to babies that can not latch on to these.
