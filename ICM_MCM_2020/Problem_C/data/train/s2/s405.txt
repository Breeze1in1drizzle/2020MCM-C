My newborn daughter was given several pacifiers, from the Avent ones to the Gerbers. She prefers the Gerbers, so we bunched them all into this pacifier tree to steam them up.<br />First off, when I received the box, I thought the tree was too small. We put about 6 pacifiers before it was stuffed.<br />Because it's small, they don't fit the Avent pacifiers too well since they don't have rings. Heck, they don't seem to hold any pacifiers if it doesn't have rings.<br /><br />The steamer seemed to work fine, but the tree was too hot out of the microwave. The drainer didn't seem to work well either, so I just had to tip over the bottom to spill the water out.<br /><br />It seems fine, but I wouldn't consider the tree a necessity.
