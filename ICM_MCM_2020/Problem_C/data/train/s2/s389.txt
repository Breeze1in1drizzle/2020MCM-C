I was told about Wubbanubs by another mother in a store who saw me struggling to keep my little girl's paci in her mouth. She told me they are suppose to hold the paci in place and keep it from falling out of the babies mouth even if they stop sucking. She said the feet were weighted to hold the whole thing on the chest of the baby. It sounded perfect, especially for the car seat and when my little girl is laying on her back. Unfortunately, there are many things wrong with this product. First of all, the pacifier is permanently attached to the stuffed animal and can not be removed to be cleaned properly. The weighted feet have a few little bean bag beads in them which do not keep it still at all. As soon as my daughter moves even slightly, the thing pulls right out of her mouth. Even when she's asleep, She has to lay perfectly still to keep it in her mouth...as soon as she moves her head, it comes out and she wakes up. At least with a regular pacifier, when she lets go of it, it falls away from her face. With this, when it comes out, its still in her face and sticks her until she gets frustrated and starts crying... If it doesn't keep the paci in the babies mouth, I'm not really sure what good it is...
