I've been using Conair hair-dryers for 20+ years. I stuck to this brand because they've always provided good merchandise that was a good value for the money. That long streak ended with this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. several different speed & heat settings provide a useful array of options<br />2. fairly inexpensive<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. there are two back filter screens; the outer one will not stay attached to the unit on the clip side, & the closing latch is defective; I removed it entirely because it doesn't seem to affect the operation of the unit considering that the second screen is built-in & usable<br />2. the hottest setting is not very hot<br />3. the slide controls are not aligned well (they slip past the detents & require too much force to push)<br />4. overall cheap construction, even for this fairly low price.<br /><br />All of this results in a poorly made unit, & not at all worth the price. A big disappointment for a dedicated Conair user. Time for me to look for another brand.
