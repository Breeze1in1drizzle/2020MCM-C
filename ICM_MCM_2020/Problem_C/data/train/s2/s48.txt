Bought this hair dryer for our trip to Italy.  Perfect traveling size, but when using the 250 voltage setting - only the high speed worked.  It got way too hot on that setting to use comfortably.  I ended up not being able to use it because it burned my skin and blew my hair too hard to style it.  I started washing my hair at night and letting it air dry.  The low and high settings work fine in the states on the other voltage, but it was a waste to buy it specifically for the dual voltage piece and then not be able to use it anyway.
