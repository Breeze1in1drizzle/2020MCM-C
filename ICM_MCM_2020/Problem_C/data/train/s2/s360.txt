The reason i bought the wubbanub is because of how much my daughter LOVED them. The wubbanub itself is amazing. I am very let down with the description by picture. The main giraffe picture is NOT what you will receive. It is completely different and not even half as cute. It might be the pregnancy hormones, but i am pretty disappointed with it :(
