I bought this a little over a year ago, used it 5 to 6 times a week to dry my short hair, and kept the dust/lint trap clean regularly. Loved this dryer and it dried my hair quickly. However, after barely a year, suddenly it blew nothing hotter than luke-warm air. I put up with this for a couple of weeks until one day it blew only cold air. Very disappointing, as I'd really liked everything else about this dryer. It's now been replaced with a lesser but more dependable brand until I can find something comparable. Look elsewhere or expect a limited product lifespan.
