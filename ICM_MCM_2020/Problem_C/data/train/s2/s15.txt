I have owned an older version of this Sunbeam hair dryer that worked well for many years -- I'm thinking at least 10.  Unfortunately, this model was purchased just several months ago and already the On switch will not always catch.  I have to keep pushing it or the Off button to get it to work. Often I find, also, that the red Reset switch was triggered.  I haven't yet contacted the company, but hope very much that they or Sunbeam will make a complimentary replacement.  If so, I will write a new review.  If not, never again will I buy a Sunbeam.<br /><br />New review:  The company from which I bought this hair dryer stands behind their product.  I have been sent a replacement as well as prepaid postage to return the original.  I am very pleased with this company's customer service.  I do hope that this Sunbeam product is free from defects.  A wall-mounted hair dryer can certainly be convenient.
