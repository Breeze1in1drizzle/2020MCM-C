We bought this on a Saturday... we used it for the first time on Sunday morning.  We only used it, maybe 2-3 times per day.  We unplugged it after each use.  Went to warm up a bottle on Wednesday evening and the switch glows red permanently now, which means it does not beep or turn off.  We haven't touched it since then... it technically still works, but not properly.  I'm ticked, because we didn't use this much at all and were very careful with it, yet it still died out on us.<br /><br />My daughter prefers her bottles warmed, so we are going to invest in another warmer, but so far, not sure on the brand... especially since this one was highly recommended.
