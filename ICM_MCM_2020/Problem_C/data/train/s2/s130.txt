Bought the first one at an RV store and it lasted for several years of daily use. When it finally wore out, bought another one (same model). After about 6 months of use, the wires in the handle had been pinched and shorted out and damaged the unit. Bought another one. My wife has been using it for the last several months and this morning there was a pop and the low speed quit. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because is  a really nice unit that we have liked, but wondering now about the quality control on recently produced units.
