I've had this hair dryer for 9 months and use it daily, but now am ready to give up on it and try a different brand. In the beginning, it worked pretty good, but it didn't take long for things to stop working correctly. Today was the final straw; after blow drying my hair this morning, it smells burnt. I'm getting rid of this thing before it starts a fire!<br /><br />PROS<br />*Comes with lots of accessories<br />*Dries hair quickly<br />*Back opens so that dust filter can be cleaned<br /><br />CONS<br />*Cool button stopped working after a few months<br />*LOUD<br />*Risk of fire/burnt hair<br />*Did not last long
