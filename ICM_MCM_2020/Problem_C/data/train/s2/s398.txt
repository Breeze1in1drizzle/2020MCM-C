I love the idea of a pacifier that pops closed when it hits the floor, and it does seem to do this very well...<br /><br />My only issue with this pacifier is that the plastic on the back of the pacifier is so cheap that it cracked very quickly - making it so that we had to take off the 'wings' that flip over the pacifier... and basically had to use it as a really strange 'normal pinky'.
