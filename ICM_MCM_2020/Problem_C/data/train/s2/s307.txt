So, first of all these say on amazon that they are made buy Hawaii Medical. When I got them, the packaging said they came from another maker. Besides that, these just weren't great pacifiers. My baby couldn't hold them in her mouth and kept accidently spitting them out. Also, the round shape really isn't good for breast feeding babies and could definitely cause some nipple confusion. I went back to using the MAM brand.
