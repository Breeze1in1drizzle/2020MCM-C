the heat stopped working after a few months from buying it. I have long and thick hair, and the blow dryer dried my hair in 20 minutes ... smooth with no frizz. I loved it. I didn't even need to use the straightener. Before the Andis 1875, I was using a cheap blow dryer, and it lasted a lot longer than the Andis, and I washed my hair every other day.  After I bought the Andis, I was washing my hair every 3rd day, and it crapped out on me after a few months. I would not recommend buying this blow dryer. :-(
