I was replacing this unit with another Sunbeam wall mount that my wife had for nearly 10 years. When this arrived first the hi-low setting didn¡¯t work. Also it isn¡¯t hard wired so you have a cord dangling off the wall. That was my fault I didn¡¯t realize it when I ordered it. So I returned it with no hassle and ordered the wall mount hard wire unit with three settings and no cord to tangle. A happy wife is a happy LIFE.
