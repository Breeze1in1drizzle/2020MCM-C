I really liked the ionic technology.  It dries hair a lot faster.  However, after a year of owning this, it broke. I had to buy another dryer from Amazon, and I chose a different one--the Conair 213x Infiniti Professional Tourmaline dryer.  I noticed that the sound on the Conair (when on high setting) was a lot quieter than the Andis.  I get the impression that the motor on the Conair is of a higher quality than that of the Andis.
