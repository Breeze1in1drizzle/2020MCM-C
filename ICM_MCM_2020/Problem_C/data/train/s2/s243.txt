We've had a SMH9187 (which search led me here) for 3 years and it's been great.<br /><br />Starting today whenever we close the door the microwave turns itself on.  I see other reports here and elsewhere of Samsung microwaves turning themselves on.  Seems like there should be a recall.<br /><br />UPDATE: They sent a tech out to replace the keypad and door latch mechanism.  Didn't solve it, but a few days later he came back out and replaced the door.  So far so good.
