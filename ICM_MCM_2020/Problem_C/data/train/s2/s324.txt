i thought these looked pretty cool when i first saw them, but once i got them i realized not only are they lame, but they are annoying as well.  the only part that glows in the dark is the dinky little handle...on top of that, the shape of the pacifier makes it so they are only meant to go one direction, with the flat side up.  this is annoying, especially fumbling around and trying to get it back in the baby's mouth at night.  get the ones that aren't curved on the bottom so they work either direction.
