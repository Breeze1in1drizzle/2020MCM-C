I just adored this when I got it.  It was cute and I understood it's function from the beginning beyond just having a pasi.  However it wasn't until I opened the package yesterday that I was disappointed (I'm due soon); the directions say to wash the pasi - got it, no biggie.  The animal - wash gentle dry low, got it.  Then as I was inspecting the product I realized the animal is sewn together WITH the pasi.<br /><br />This didn't make sense to me.  So you're supposed to wash the animal in the washer, with the pasi attached to it, allowing any soap you might use in the washer to soak into the pasi.  Or you could not use any detergent but either way I'm sure the pasi can't be washed in a washer too frequently.<br /><br />You can't remove or reattach the pasi unless you take the stitch out and then restitch the (or a new) pasi into the mouth of the animal.  I was expecting some clip or tie or something else other than permanent attachment of the two objects; for cleaning purposes this is completely unpractical.<br /><br />I gave it two stars instead of just one because it is adorable. It is another baby-item that may or may-not work depending on how my child takes it.  The rating is not based upon if my kid throws it or not because that would defeat the purpose of rating the product as-it-is verses what my kid does with it.
