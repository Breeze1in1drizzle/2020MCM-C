My baby just doesn't like this paci. She seems to like to chew on it since she is teething. Otherwise we could not get her to take it instead of her other brand. The size and shape seem to be difficult for her to latch on to for a long period and she was 5 months when I gave it to her. Oh well. Don't waste your money.
