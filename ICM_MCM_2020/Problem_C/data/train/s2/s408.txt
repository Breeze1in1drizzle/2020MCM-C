In a nutshell -- don't waste your time with these.  1st - they are big, huge really, and they cause my son to drool - a lot - while sucking on them so that when I take it out of his mouth I have to wipe his face.  2nd - The glow in the dark part works for about 15 minutes.  I bought these hoping I wouldn't have to hunt around his crib in the middle of the night for his pacifier -- yep -- still hunting!  If your child already has another pacifier they like, do yourself a favor and either get the clip that attaches to their clothes...or buy more of the kind they already like.
