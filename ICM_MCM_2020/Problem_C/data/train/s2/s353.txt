My kids have absolutely adored these pacifiers. My daughter who is now 5 used the mam pacifiers and now they are the only ones my 6 month old will take. I cannot say enough good things about them. I am however very disappointed in the color we received. I chose to order from this particular one because I could choose the color where most I came across said colors will vary and I didn't want to chance it. I got them yesterday and they were not the green I requested, but very pink. I will be returning them, and will look else where to purchase. I am highly disappointed that they gave me a choice than ignored it. Just beware that this could happen.<br /><br />Just wanted to update that I contacted the seller and they exchanged for boy colors and did it very fast and wereggreat about it.
