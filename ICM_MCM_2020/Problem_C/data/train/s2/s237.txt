Was extremely happy with the performance of this oven while it worked, however after only 4 months of moderate usage it stopped working completely: it made a loud droning sound, followed by the smell of electrical burning, and then would no longer would heat up anything. I would also note that the mechanism to open the door is annoying- it is located under the control panel and it would be better to have it on the door handle.
