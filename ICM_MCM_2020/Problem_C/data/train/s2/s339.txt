Just recieved it today and fell in love with it even more...In the picture provided by amazon it doesn't show just how beautiful the brown is on this cute little monkey...The only thing that is really disappointing is that the pacifier doesn't detach so when its time to replace it I'll have to get rid of the monkey as well :(
