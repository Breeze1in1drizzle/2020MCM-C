I was hoping that this Revlon drier was a great bargain, and that its price of $12 wasn't an indication of a cheap or shoddy product.  When it arrived, I was chagrined.  It was a very light, very cheap feeling product, which also only had two possible heat settings.  All in all, a very unimpressive hair dryer; I guess sometimes you do get what you paid for.
