The one good thing about this hair dryer is that it is quiet.  Other than that, it is no better than my $15, ten year-old Conair.  The Elchim did not dry my hair any faster and my hair is less frizzy when I let my hair air dry.  I wanted a high-end hair dryer and was disappointed.  I didn't find the Elchim to be worth the price.
