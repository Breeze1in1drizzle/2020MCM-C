We bought this microwave 2 years ago.  It worked well during that time, but it recently stopped working.  We were warming up some food when the microwave started smoking.  When we opened the door, all we could smell was the stench of burnt plastic.      After waiting a day for the smell to clear out, I tried running the microwave with nothing in it.  After 10 seconds, I opened the door and could again smell the burnt plastic.  On the right side of the microwave behind the metal grate where all the wiring is, I could hear sizzling.    The internal wiring was melting and that was causing the smell and smoke.  In searching for a new microwave to replace this one, I read in Consumer Reports that Sharp brand microwaves are a repair-prone brand.    As other reviewers have stated, this is a good, basic microwave.  But, if you are expecting it to last for several years, I'd select a different brand and model.  Frigidaire, Whirlpool, Maytag, Amana, GE, and Kenmore (Sears) all get good ratings for reliability from Consumer Reports.
