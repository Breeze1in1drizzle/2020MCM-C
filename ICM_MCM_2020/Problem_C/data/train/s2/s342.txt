I bought these for my one year old daughter because I had read that they did a great job of mimicking the natural movement and softness of a real nipple because they stretch. (She is a night nurser and I'm trying to get her to stop using my breasts as a pacifier.)<br /><br />They looked nice when we got them, so I let her try one. She sucked for a few seconds and then threw it across the room! Every time I put it in her mouth, she'd do the same thing. I thought I'd try sucking on one to see what it felt like for her, and immediately my top lip was pinched between the hard plastic outer piece and the soft silicone. No wonder she didn't want to suck - it hurts! The other one did the same. I also noticed that the nipple has a very apparent and somewhat scratchy seam around it. I can't imagine that feeling very natural for a baby. Overall we were disappointed.
