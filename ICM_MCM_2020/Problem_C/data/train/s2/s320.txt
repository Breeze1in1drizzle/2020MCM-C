If you're desperate for sleep and looking for a solution to your baby losing the pacifier at night, save your money and rest assured that the time when baby can put the pacifier back in without help WILL come. Here's why you should skip the wubbanubs :<br /><br />1.  They're too small and lightweight to really hold the pacifier in place.<br /><br />2.  They may contribute to the problem.  My son yanks on the animal and then ends up with a leg or ear in his mouth,  crying in frustration. The animal is just another means for pulling out the paci.<br /><br />3.  The cleaning instructions for the pacifier and the plush part are different,  which makes no sense since the pacifier is sewn on.<br /><br />It got a two star rating because they are cute and double as a toy.
