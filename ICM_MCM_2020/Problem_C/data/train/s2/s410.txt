Be aware these pacifiers are MUCH harder than the 0-3 month ones. I ordered several two packs and it didn't say what age they were for. When they showed up one said 3m+ on them and when I went to wash them I noticed they felt a bit less squishy but I didn't think anything of it. Well my eight month son is not having it. I gave him one, he put it in his mouth sucked once and then took it out, looked it over, and threw it! He's done it every time I've given it to him, he hates them and I've given up. I feel I should mention he was started on these in the NICU and won't take any other type of pacifier. So if you're concerned your kid might not like them, buy from a store where you can easily return them.`
