The description of this item did not explain that it is a much tougher rubber than the infant size.  My daughter is 3mo+ so based upon the description this is the size I purchased.  The rubber is so tough she cannot use the soothie.  I contacted the company on this issue and received very poor customer service.  I would not recommend buying from this company.
