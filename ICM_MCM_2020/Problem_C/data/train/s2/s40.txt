I bought this 5 months ago, and it croaked. Just like that,it starting to smell burned (w/o smoke) and then it stopped. It wasn't the socket, it was the dryer.  Too bad--it was a good price and it when it worked, it worked well. The best part about it was the retractable cord....next!  Go for a brand name like Conair or Sasson.  Their dryers last.
