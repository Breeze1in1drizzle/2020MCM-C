The hair dryer is fine if you don't need to change the voltage, but I bought it for international traveling, and it's a big con for me that the switch doesn't turn to 250 volts. It looks as though it can easily turn with a coin. Do not be fooled. It's impossible to turn the switch to 250 volts. I stripped the switch bare trying to turn the damn thing. I can barely see where the arrow is, which points to which voltage setting it's at. Luckily for me (sarcasm), mine is permanently at 125 volts. Maybe mine was faulty, but I was definitely not happy with this product. Would not recommend to a friend. Two stars only because the hair dryer itself works fine and because it's cheap.
