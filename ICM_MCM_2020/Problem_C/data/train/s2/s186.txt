First I will say that it dries hair just like any other hair dryer so I guess it does what it's supposed to do.  But, the use of toggle switches for power and temperature right on the handle instead of a sliding switch seems like poor planning at best.  Every time I change hand positions I'm accidentally turning it off or moving it from hot to warm.  The only way to avoid doing that is to not put your hand around the inside of the handle - I've dropped the dumb thing on the floor more times than I can count while trying to avoid turning it off!  All other dryers I've ever used have switches that slide up or down and only move when you want them to, not just if you accidentally touch it.  And the cord is very short as well - much shorter than any I've had in the past.  This dryer will be going to &#34;back-up&#34; status as soon as I get a better replacement.
