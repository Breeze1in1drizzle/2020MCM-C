everyone seems to love these. I received four or five of them from the hospital and they were all vanilla scented .but they will not stay in my sons mouths i have to fall asleep with my hand holding it in his mouth!!! bc he will wake up if it out, its so heavy and odd.  i have a wub anub but realistically is everyone going to buy on to use these? nope .... also my son is 7 weeks and he will grab onto the little tab that sitcks out and rip it out of his mouth and then scream when its gone, major design flaw.. obv its so you can pull it out but jezz it makes my life harder. and when you drop them they fly all over the friggen place like a possessed bouncy ball from hell who has it out to make your life and your screaming babies life hell while you are searching for it. only to find it ten minutes later 15 ft across the room in the opposite direction. Im still searching for the perfect pacy for my baby
