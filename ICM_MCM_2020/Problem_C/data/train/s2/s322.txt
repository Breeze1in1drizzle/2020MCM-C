My son had absolutely no interest in this pacifier.  I love penguins and I love the thought of having a pacifier that closes when it falls to keep it clean...but given my son won't use it, I am giving it 2 stars based upon the product in theory!  Playing around with it, it does generally close when I drop it.  It appears very bulky and uncomfortable in terms of being used by a baby as a pacifier.  The shell that closes over it makes it bulky and unappealing, I would imagine, for a baby to use.<br /><br />All in all, super cute but I don't recommend.
