I bought this pacifier about 5 months ago to see if my twins would like it, but they didn't. So now is used as a toy, they like to test their motor skills with it, just don't put it in their mouths.<br />What I liked about the product:<br />- It's BPA free, but honestly, most baby product are.<br />- Doesn't have cracks which makes it easy to wash.<br />- it's made out of rubber. This is convenient if your baby likes to fall asleep with it and then rolls over it.<br /><br />What I don't like about the product:<br />-did you look at the price??? $9 for a pacifier is a little too much. Particularly when pacifiers are a hit or miss kind of a thing.<br />-it does have a funky smell at first.<br /><br />In my opinion this product is not worth it. Is way too expensive for what it is and there are a lot of reasonably priced products out there. Keep in mind that if your baby likes it you'll need a few to keep around. So, unless your baby refuses all other pacifiers I wouldn't give this a try.
