Pros: Many attachments, price is good, attractive, dries quickly, no damage.    Cons: So heavy to use and that factor alone is enough to cancel out any of the pros.  The weight is also unbalanced, so when you grip the handle in the place that best balances it out, you wind up hitting buttons.  The attachments fly off and hit you in the head midstream (especially the diffuser).  Not recommended.  You can do better.
