I've been using this dryer for about 3 weeks now and the airflow on the lowest settings is too strong.  Even with the diffuser on, my hair frizzes every time.  It doesn't dry my hair as fast as I expected it to either.  I also don't really like that the controls are on the back of the handle.  I end up changing the settings without knowing it.  I was using a T3 tourmaline dryer and loved it, but I thought I'd try something different this time.  I'll be going back to the T3 because it's better in every way.  I'm giving the FHI to my niece who straightens her hair.  I'm sure it would be great for her.
