Perhaps I just got a bum microwave, but everything comes out hot on the outside and cold in the middle. And there's no sensor cook like the Panasonic microwaves, so choosing the &#34;frozen vegetable&#34; settings cooks the vegetables for 3.5 minutes at 60%, which is less than a third what it actually needs. I got this to replace a faulty Panasonic (since Panasonic customer service was TERRIBLE), but I'm going back to Panasonic.
