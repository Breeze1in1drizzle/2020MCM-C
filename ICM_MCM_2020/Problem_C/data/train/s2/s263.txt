Lousy Value - Stopped working after 2 years of relatively light use (1-2x a day). I was one of the unlucky owners of the previous version of this microwave. It worked fine for 2 years and then just stopped. Whirlpool wasn't too helpful - offered me a warranty that cost more than buying a new one. Then we wonder why we have a landfill issue like we do... Whirlpool should be accountable. I'm taking my money and buying another brand.<br /><br />When it worked, I generally liked it but the fan is loud and comes on by itself. I did like the auto defrost feature but I'm sure others have that.
