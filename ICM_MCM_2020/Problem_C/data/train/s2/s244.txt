I bought this microwave 18 months ago from Sears and it looked good and worked just fine until the SE error message came up a week ago. Then the keypad stopped working. We tried plugging and unplugging, and I have tried all of the fixes found online but to no avail. I am now planning to replace it with a quality product. so much for buying a good looking product that reviewers say works well. I want my appliances to last more than a year and half.
