I got this because it was touted as a mini-microwave. Of course, I am capable of reading the dimensions, which I did, but when it arrived it still seemed shockingly huge for a mini or compact microwave. It simply won't work with my limited counter-space. I don't know how well it works, because after trying it in various spots, I put it right back in the box. BTW, it is $30 to send back, so make sure you want it before you order.
