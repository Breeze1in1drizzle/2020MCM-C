I was a bit concerned after reading some of the ratings, but I took the plunge -- and I'm glad I did.  It does everything as good or better than advertised.  As with most products, the manual could stand some extra effort (simplification), so those who don't read it do so at their own peril.  Both my wife and I are pleased with this product and hope it lasts as long as my original Samsung (11 years).
