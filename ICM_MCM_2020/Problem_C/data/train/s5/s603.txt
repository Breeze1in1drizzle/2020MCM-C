OK, I never write reviews, but this hair dryer is so great, I just had to. It looks very basic, but it is everything you could want in a hair dryer and more. It is powerful, quiet, dries my hair in a flash, and from the very first time I used it, it made my hair amazingly soft and shiny. I didn't even know a hair dryer could make that much difference! This is hands down the best hair dryer I have ever used.
