We purchased and installed the drawer oven in August 2010, while doing a remodel in our kitchen.  It was a more expensive option, but it fit perfectly in a location between our fridge and sink area, and maintained the contour of the kitchen we were seeking.  We use it at least two or three times a day, and have been very pleased with its performance, and we have not had any problems with it.  It does not have a turntable; however, our experience is it does the job just as well.  It is easy to get to and easy to clean.  It does not have a huge interior, so if you have plans to microwave tall items, check the dimensions first so that you are not surprised by that.  Overall, we have found it to be a very nice addition to our kitchen, and would purchase one again.
