Absolutely awesome plush soft permanebtly attached pacifier. As you can see in my attached picture, you can wrap their little arms and hands around the bear to hold toghtly in place. Stays in the cuddly caress of her embrace as she falls to sleep quietly suckling her &#34;bobo&#34;. Great invention! Just clean with soap and water. Thought it would be weird thats its permanently attached; but no, it works-perfectly!
