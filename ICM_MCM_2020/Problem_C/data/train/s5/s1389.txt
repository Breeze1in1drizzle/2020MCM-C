Let me start with the removable filter which allows you to  clean the dust out, my previous dryers did not have this option and the filter would clog diminishing the airflow and the drying ability. That is why this is such an important feature to me,you would think all hair dryers would have it!<br />Now to its features: it has 3 heat settings and 2 power settings (*wish there were 3!)<br /> annnd a &#34;cool shot&#34; which Iove, Love, LOVE! I have very thin, fine hair and when I set my hair with heat rollers I use the &#34;cool shot&#34; feature to speed up the &#34;set&#34; and my curls stay in longer as the hair is more cooled down before I take the rollers out so the curls don't fall out as quickly as they used to, my set lasts longer.<br />I use the concentrator but have no need for the diffuser but if you are naturally curly it is a nice attachment to have.<br />It has the heat protection &#34;ionic technology&#34; that helps keep your hair frizz and fly away free, dries hair fast (I have long hair) and doesn't tangle it up when just doing a blow dry and not setting my curls.<br />It has a 2 year warranty and is at a GREAT price for what you get. I would recommend this dryer.
