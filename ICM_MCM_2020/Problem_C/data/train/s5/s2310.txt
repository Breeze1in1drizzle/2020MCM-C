I am a school nurse and have been using this and the professional level one. It is very accurate. I have found that when you do not watch the instruction CD and read the directions, it will seem that this does not work. It works great, no spit transmission, and it never misses a fever. Folks have to realize that to get an ideal temp, a patient has to wait 15 minutes to get acclimated to the room. If a kid comes in from the cold outside his skin temp will be cool thus a lower temp. Most kids with fever come in red cheeked, red ears, irritable, and lethargic plus other symptoms. I usually recheck only the fevers with a B&D digital under the tongue thermometer (which is consider the most accurate way to test). I would say that 99% of the time the two match. Confounding factors are: did the child have a cold drink after lunch before he came into the office? Is the child dehydrated? Has the child not been fed? Dehydration can raise core temp. Not eating a meal can reduce temp since metabolism is slowed due to no body fuel. Cold drinks cool down the mouth and head. Temp is dynamic and changes throughout the day with one's circadium cycle. Last thoughts, if you have 2 thermometers and one reads normal and the other reads high, which one is right or wrong? There is more to an assessment than temp just saying.
