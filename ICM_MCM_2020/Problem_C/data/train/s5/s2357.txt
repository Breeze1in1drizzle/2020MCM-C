we are so relieved that our son liked this pacifier.  He is exclusively breastfed and he is now 5 months.  After trying 5 different pacifier a friend gave me a Mexican honey filled pacifier and my son loved it.  We were scared it would pop but also I enjoyed the extra sleep, and  personal time.  I needed to find a pacifier that didn't frighten me yet he loved.  this one looks and feels just like the Mexican one.  I purchased the rounded butterfly 12 months and older.  I'm going to order a size down and keep this size for the future or as a spare.
