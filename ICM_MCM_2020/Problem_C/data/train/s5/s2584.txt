They stay in his mouth and don't fall out and he took to these immediately after trying several others including Dr. Browns pacifiers and the one the hospital gave us and the soothie pacifiers (they popped out of his mouth even with a stuffed animal attached).  He is 5 months old.  They also come with a sanitizing box which you can microwave them in 3 minutes which I find easier than boiling.  MAM also sells a pacifier clip but it does not fit tightly enough for use on these small pacifiers.
