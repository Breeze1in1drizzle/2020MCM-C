I needed new hair dryers for upstairs and downstairs bathrooms and didn't want to pay too much. I don't do a lot of styling, mostly just wash and dry, so I didn't need a lot of attachments. This one suited me perfectly. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth.<br />My old dryer was a Conair and worked well for years. I hope this one lasts as long.<br />To anyone looking for a nice simple hair dryer, reasonably priced, I would recommend this one.
