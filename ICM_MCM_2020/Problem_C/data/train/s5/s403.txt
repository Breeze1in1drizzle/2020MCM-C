Our blow dryer died recently. Panic!! But we just didn't have the opportunity to hunt around in local stores to find a replacement for the one we'd had for so long. I took a chance and looked on Amazon and there it was ... the exact one we wanted! It has a lot of power and we're very pleased with it.
