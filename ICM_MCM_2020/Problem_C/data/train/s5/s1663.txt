This microwave is excellent for the small household and the person who does not do complex cooking.  It's full-plate size, fine for heat-ups and smaller casserole dishes.  Best of all is the way it fits into a corner.  Yes it takes up space, is not &#34;tiny&#34; but fits under cabinets and leaves you more counter space.  Controls are easy to set.  Haven't had a microwave in years, and somebody suggested this.  I'm happy with it.
