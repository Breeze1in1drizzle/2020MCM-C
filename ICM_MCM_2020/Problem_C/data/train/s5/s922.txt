I had this dryer for years and they don't sell it in the stores around me any more so I was so happy when I found it on Amazon!  Love this dryer it does such a nice job with my curls! I ordered an extra one for the future, my daughters dryer died so she took my extra to use until she could replace hers. Well she loves it so much she just ordered two more one for me and a backup for herself!
