I've had this blow dryer for probably a little longer than a year and I absolutely love it. It's blow power is incredibly strong compared to most dryers (think hurricane vs gentle breeze). Of course, you can use the low setting which is powerful too but if you want to dry your hair fast, this dryer will not disappoint. It also heats up quickly, cools down quickly, comes with several attachments, and has a long cord. The only downside is that I don't like where the buttons are because the way I hold it to dry my hair, many times, I accidentally turn the heat onto cool without meaning to. I would buy this a thousand times over.
