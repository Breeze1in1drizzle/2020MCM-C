I have a small kitchen and my old microwave was a full sized microwave that took up a large amount of cabinet space and seemed out of place because of its size.  Shopped around and found this smaller sized unit but was hesitant because it is 700 watts while my old unit was 1000 watts.  However, I have found that cooking time in this unit is insignificantly longer than the old microwave.  A few second for most things.  I don't actually cook in it but use it for warming left overs or frozen snacks, etc.  For my use it is perfect and it is an attractive addition to my kitchen rather than a huge distraction.  If you need a smaller sized microwave, I highly recommend this one.
