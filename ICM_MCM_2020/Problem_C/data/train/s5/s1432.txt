The microwave is light on features but works very well for the functions it provides.  It's a very simple micowave that does it's core job well which is exactly what I wanted.  I didn't need all of the advanced features, cooking presets and auto-options that the more expensive microwaves come with.  I installed the microwave in a couple hours removing the old one that didn't work anymore and had a bag of popcorn right after...
