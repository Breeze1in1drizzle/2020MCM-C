My son has tried so many different types and brands of pacifiers, only to find that MAM are the only ones that he likes. The Avent ones are a close second but they fall out easier than these. My son used the smaller MAM ones before but after 4 months or so he wanted something bigger, and this was it. When choosing a pacifier, try to consider the kind of bottle nipple your baby likes. Mine uses the Playtex bottles, so I suppose he is used to a larger nipple. The gerber pacifiers were very highly recommended to me, so your baby may like those if they use a bottle with smaller nipples, such as Dr. Browns bottles. Anyway, good luck and I hope this pacifier will work for your baby too. It has saved us from hours and hours of complaining. :-)
