I bought this hairdryer to use while vacationing in Europe.  It worked great!  It is true that you can only use the low setting in Europe; however, it seemed as though the low setting was  putting out as much air as the high setting usually does here in the US.  Also, I only took a small carry-on suitcase to Europe.  Because of the fold-down capability, this hairdryer fit perfectly into my carry-on.  I would highly recommend this product!
