Our daughter is two months old and has been using these pacifiers since the first few weeks of life. Unlike other pacifiers that we have bought (soothers, etc), the outside of these pacifiers are not heavy and fit well against the newborn/infants face and mouth, therefore they don't fall out as easily when they stop sucking. Also, the holes along the edges make it easy to attach to a pacifier clip and attach to a seat or the babies clothing. A must for new babies!
