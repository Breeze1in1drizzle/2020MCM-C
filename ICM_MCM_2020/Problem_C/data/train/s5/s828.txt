Love this powerful dryer.  It's pretty heavy duty, and it's a little heavier in weight than any other dryer I've had.  But it has the cool setting medium heat and High fast dry mode.  Pretty loud, but what hair dryer isn't it?  It smoothes the hair too , removing the frizz.  Combine with correct hairbrush and you will have salon results!
