It's amazing you don't know how bad your old hair dryer was until you purchase a new one! This hairdryer has so much power but is also quieter than others.  My old hair dryer took 20 min to blow dry my thin, fine hair. This one only took 5 min! Love the neon green color and love how the handle folds for travel.  Works great!
