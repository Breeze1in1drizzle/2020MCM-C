I've had 5 breastfed babies, 4 of whom completely refused any kind of pacifier. My youngest baby is a month old & seems to really like his Natursutten pacifier! He still prefers the breast for comfort, but will take this pacifier in the car or when someone else is holding him. I'm ordering 2 more today so we always have one one hand!
