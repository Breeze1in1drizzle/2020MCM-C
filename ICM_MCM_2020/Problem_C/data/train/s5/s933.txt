I love this hairdryer. It does blow HARD on the high setting, which is exactly what I wanted. I also love the hot, medium and cold settings. You can set it there and go on your way - unlike other hairdryers where you have to hold down a &#34;cold&#34; button to get the cold air. I try to use the medium setting as much as possible to limit the heat damage to my hair. The only thing that would make this hairdryer better is a retractable cord! :-D
