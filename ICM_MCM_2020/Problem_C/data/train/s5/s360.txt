I'm sooo glad I bought this blow dryer, it gets my African American hair really straight and makes flat ironing 10 times easier! The comb attachment is the best part, next to the hot and cool switches you can flip to the position you want without having to hold them down. Buy this blow dryer and you won't want another one.
