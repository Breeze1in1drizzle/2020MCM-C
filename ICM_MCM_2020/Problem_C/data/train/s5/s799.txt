I bought this as a replacement for my daughter's old compact hairdryer.  I haven't used it myself; but based on what she said--it is small, light, cute, not obnoxiously loud, doesn't get too hot, and doesn't suck her hair into the intake (like her old one did.) The first day she used it, she came downstairs and said, Either I'm having a fabulously lucky hair day, or this hairdryer is as awesome as it's supposed to be!  We are pleased with the purchase and would buy this item again.
