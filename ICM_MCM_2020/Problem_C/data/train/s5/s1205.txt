I purchased this hair dryer after seeing the raving reviews and it is indeed true. I have long thick hair and it certainly dries my hair a lot quicker than the other dryers. In addition, the heat is not too strong and this is helpful as it does not dry out the root too much at the same time dries the hair just right with a good flow of air. I'm very satisfied and highly recommend! This is a good buy...
