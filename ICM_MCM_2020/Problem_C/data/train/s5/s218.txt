I used this hairdryer for the first time at a resort that we were staying at and just loved it.  I loved the idea of the retractable cord and folding head,  it just seemed to dry my hair so much easier and better that what I had used previously.  Before I left the resort I went to my computer and looked it up and was amazed at how reasonably priced it was and ordered one right then.  I highly recommend this dryer!
