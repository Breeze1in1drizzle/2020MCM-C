My daughter ADORES her monkey wubbanub. She asks for it by name. She has a special laugh for it. If I would allow her to have it 24-7, it would only leave her mouth long enough for her to eat.<br /><br />However, I am concerned about the wubbanub monkey being a bad influence. We were travelling through an airport and as my daughter and I were getting ready to walk through the metal detector, a TSA agent informed me that she needed to x-ray and inspect the wubbanub monkey. I was initially surprised because wubbanub monkey has always been a faithful, comforting friend. He would never harm anyone. But apparently, the wubbanub monkey is the new face of terrorism. He looks sweet and innocent, but I guess those are the ones who look really suspicious. After trying to explain to my daughter why they were taking her monkey away, the wubbanub monkey was placed in a bowl, given a visual inspection, and run separately though the x-ray machine. My daughter still loves her monkey, but I can't look at him the same anymore. I hope that by giving him lots of love, we can deter him from his path of potential terrorism.
