I bought this dryer because it came with a diffuser and I needed a dual voltage dryer for travel to Europe. It folds down and is great for travel. It works well on both 110 and 220V. Reviews of other dryers said that they only worked on high when using 220V, but this has both low and high on both voltages. The diffuser does a decent job of diffusing the air and dried my hair well without firzzing it. I only plan to use it for travel and only used it for 2 weeks overseas, so I can't vouch for its durability. At this time, though, I am very satisfied with it.
