Bought this dryer to help with my dense wavy hair frizzing when I blow dried it. This seem to do the job well. It has lots of options for heat and speed, and gets my hair dry faster than my old &#34;cheapy&#34; dryer. I have noticed less frizzing and my hair is smoother and shiner than before. I would give it good marks for value for money, it appears to do the job as well as more expensive ceramic dryers I looked at.
