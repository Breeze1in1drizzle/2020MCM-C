I installed this little hair dryer because I was tired of the hair dryer and cord laying on my sink and counter -- it always seemed to be in the way.  My concerns that this hair dryer was not powerful enough turned out to be for naught.  Excellent hair dryer, plenty of power and a lower setting for those who like to take twice as long with their hair (like my GF).  Easy to mount -- love the hook to hang the cord on.
