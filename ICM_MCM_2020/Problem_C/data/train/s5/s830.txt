I just got mine today and to test it I decided to do my sister's hair ! So When i open the box let me tell you I didnt expect it to be so small . However , according to the description it was said to have more power . I told my self I'll be the judge of that been that I had the twin turbo 3200  so I said this one should deff do better . So I did her hair & finished it very quickly actually  and I can say the hair was very shinny, the size did not have anything to do  with the power this blow dryer provided!!! So I am pleased with the results the hair was very soft and like glowy which never happened with the other dryer !
