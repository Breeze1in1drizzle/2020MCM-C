A replacement for another Conair, this one is the best. There are cheaper models, but this one is very well made and we have every reason to expect the longevity other reviewers have noted. I use the low setting (I used to use high on my old one) and it works beautifully and is much quieter. The cord retractor is great; at first I expected this to be just a marketing gimmick, but now I wouldn't buy a dryer without one. Very nice to pull the cord in and drop the dryer in a drawer without having to roll up the cord first, and then untangle it whenever you take it out. We ended up buying two of these to prevent my daughter from swiping it and having to search. Nice to find a product that is well made and reasonably priced. This is not a cheap throw-away, it is a good value.
