My little 2 month old likes to eat so much she will overeat and vomit. Now I give this to her when I think she has eaten enough.  She actually hugs it to her, pulls its ears, and has stopped eating too much.  If she is full, her elephant soothes her, and if not, she pulls it out and cries for more food!
