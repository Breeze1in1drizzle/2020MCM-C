We live in the Seattle area and our baby was given orange Gumdrop pacifiers in the hospital when she was born. She loved them and had no interest in other pacifiers. I went to Target and Babies R Us looking for more, and thought I would just get the pink/purple package of what looked like the same Gumdrop pacifiers. Upon opening the package, I realized they are not the same! The ones from the store are smoother/shinier. The pacifiers from the hospital have a little more of a rubbery texture to them. My baby knew the difference too, and rejected the store versions. I was so thankful to find they sell the hospital versions on Amazon! We stocked up and baby is now very happy. Great quality product!
