I love my hair dryer.  I was only looking because my mom needs a new hair dryer.  I saw a few negative reviews about the quality.  So since mine is pretty old, I can't vouch for the current quality standards of this product.  I've been super lucky with mine.  It gets daily use if not more. I always wished it had additional heat settings but using the cool burst has worked well for be. My cord has never frayed as others reported, but many times the last few inches of cord don't retract. I keep it clear of lint and I think that is a huge saver on its useful life.  I hope everyone has the excellent experience I have had.  Everytime I look at a Revlon or Conair hair dryer, I cringe. I've never had one of those last more than a year. After 10 years, I would purchase this product again, but mine just doesn't want to die just yet!
