I used to have a Babyliss (Conair's high-end line) and it started giving me problems roughly 4 weeks into having it. After a while I got fed up with the Babyliss and decided to purchase this well-rated hair dryer.<br />I like that there are three temperature settings, good air flow, and two attachments for channeled or diffused air. I have curly hair, so I use both attachments and are happy with their performance. Another great thing about this product is that I can feel safe that the intake side won't suck up my long hair and result in unfortunate hair loss. The mesh is good quality and in a tight configuration. The intake is also very easy to ope/close, which makes it easy to clean out any dust that may accumulate overtime. Whenever I clean the intake, I feel like my hair dryer is new since the air flow is so good after cleaning.<br />I have had this hair dryer for over a year and would repurchase it for the price and functionality.
