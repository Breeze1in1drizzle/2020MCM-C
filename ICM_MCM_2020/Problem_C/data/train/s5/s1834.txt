We got one of these when our daughter was born a few weeks ago and looked around to find some more. They're very hard to find in stores and mainstream brand has even copied the design and name (not sure if it was licensed?). The reviews on that product aren't ideal, but this pacifier is much softer and is one that my daughter will take much more than any others we've tried.
