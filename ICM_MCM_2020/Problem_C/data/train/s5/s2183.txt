This is so soft and lovely. It's perfect for the baby to hold on to and then snuggle at the same time. A baby that can reach for things can find it easily in the crib at night. I wish the pacifier came in a larger size for older babies, although, I have found, that my baby is not picky to the little difference in the size. I wouldn't let that deter a parent of an older baby to try this out.
