Wattage not too high and just the right size.  It's small enough to tote to the pool in my gym bag, but large enough to do a great job at home, too.  I have had it a couple of years now.  It looks like it might continue to work--unlike so many other electrical products in this day and age of globalized manufacturing.  I cannot tell you hiow much money I spend just trying to get away from products made by slave labor!
