Pros (mam binkies really are the best):<br />1.  When your baby gets to be old enough to bring things to his/her mouth, these binkies are very easy to get in!  There's no upside-down (like there is with most orthodontic pacifiers), and there's no floppy hook in the way.<br />2.  They're weighted extraordinarily well, and when they fall 90% of the time, they land without touching the nipple to the ground!  This is an enormously valuable feature!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  They're a little hard to come by, so when you find them, you've got to stock up!  I can only find the 6 mo size at Walgreens and my local grocery stores.<br />2.  They're more pricey than others.  (worth it, tho!)<br />3.  You can't pick the colors when ordered from Amazon.  I lucked out and got blue for my boy, but I could have received pink.
