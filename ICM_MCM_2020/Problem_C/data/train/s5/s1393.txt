I am very happy so far with this dryer.  The controls are easy to manipulate, even while drying and styling.  The slight downward tilt is actually genius as it is more ergonomic than regular dryers.  And the company, XTAVA, has reached out to me, expressing their desire that I am happy with their product and to please let them know if I have questions.  I find this very refreshing and impressive.
