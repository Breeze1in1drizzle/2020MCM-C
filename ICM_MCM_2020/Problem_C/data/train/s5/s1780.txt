I recieved my first Wubbanub when my son was in the NICU after being born, he was a month and a half premature, and they gave them these pacifiers because they could be positioned to not fall out of their little mouths, and the weight of the plush animals, provided comfort.  After we got home, our dog got ahold of the Wubbanub, and tore it up. It was a looooong night, it is the only pacifier my son would take! I searched all over the internet looking for replacements, and finally came across some. These are great for the car too, because if they drop them in their carseat, they can usually grab it and put it back in their mouth. Now,I only wish they made them with the Super Soothies! If you know someone who is expecting this is a great, UNIQUE gift, that they won't even know how much they will LOVE!!
