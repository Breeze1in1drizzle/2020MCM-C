Works great; same dryer used by my hair stylist.  Here's the caveat:  Since I bought it from DiscountJungle via Amazon.com, the manufacturer would not honor their 4-year warranty.  They told me they only warranty products sold (at full retail cost) by their authorized vendors, adding that hair dryers sold by Amazon.com or by DiscountJungle were often used (not new) or knock-off copies of their product.  The manufacturer strongly recommended that I return the product to DiscountJungle, and buy one from their website, or from Nordstrom (one of their few vendors); then the manufacturer assured me they would warranty the hair dryer.  I phoned DiscountJungle, explained all this to them, and was assured that mine was brand new (sure looked new to me), and that DiscountJungle would honor the 4-year warranty.  I got that in writing from them, and then I was able to start using the hair dryer.  It was no fun going through all this.  Just be prepared...
