Absolute bargain of the century! My wife had two Chi's break in the course of around five years. While most would argue that 2-3 years is adequate - when one pays $100+ for a hairdryer, you expect to see many long years of service. Instead of sinking another hundo into what is just a high priced Chinese made hair dryer, we took a gamble on the Herstyler Pro. The result? My wife is 101% pleased - really. FIt and finish is as good as the Chi. Logical button placement and function is perfect. Temps are ideal, force is great and the whole hairdryer feels like a salon professional. They could double the price and it would still be a steal. VERY well done. I like it so much, we are buying a second to stick on the shelf if the first ever gives up the ghost.
