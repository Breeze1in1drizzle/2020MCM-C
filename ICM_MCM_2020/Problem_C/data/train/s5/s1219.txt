I bought this dryer to use on my 8 month old puppy because it was supposed to be quiet. It's not real quiet, but then it is blowing air. My dog was a little shy of it at first. But taking time to introduce him to it slowly worked fine. He now looks forward to being blow dried after his bath and when we come in out of the rain or snow. It seems well made. I will have to see how long it lasts.
