This thing is awesome. It looks just like a TV which cracks me up. It's a bit smaller than most microwaves in terms of counter-space, but also a bit taller. It has no number pad for entering a specific cook time; instead you just hit the start button multiple times to add 30 seconds. It is powerful and simple. No complaints.
