LOVE IT!!!<br /><br />I had no idea what these were for.  I thought they were just stuffed animals attached to pacifiers.  I didn't realize I needed one until I was at the pediatricians office with my two month old and another mom showed me what they did while my daughter kept spitting out her pacifier.  Quickly, I ran to amazon and purchased the pacifier.  It took a couple days to come in but the shipping was super fast and I immediately cleaned it and put it to use.  It works great.  My two month old is just getting to the stage where she is starting to grab for things in reach and she likes her pacifier sometimes when she is over tired (despite my best efforts for naps) to help her settle down.  I haven't used it in the car yet, which is where I need it most, but I'm sure it'll be great.  It's nice that it stays in range and when she spits her paci out she can easily get it back in with a little effort.<br /><br />The only downfall I see with the design of the product is that you can't take the paci off to really clean it.  Yes you can wash it in soapy water like the instructions say and I did that.  I just wish I could run it through my dishwasher like I do the other things to make sure it's really sterilized.  But, then I'm kinda germaphobic when it comes to my little one.  Definitely worth the price and definitely a great idea.<br /><br />The fabric is super soft and the little caterpillar is just the right size that my daughter's tiny hands can really grab onto it.  She seems to like the soft feel.  The little feet have beans in them so that it helps the animal stay on her chest when she is laying in her car seat or swing and needs a little extra soothing.  The pacifier is sewn into the stuffed animal part so there is no worry about fingers or anything getting caught in a loop or something like that.  The fabrics are bright and cute.  I love the little thing!
