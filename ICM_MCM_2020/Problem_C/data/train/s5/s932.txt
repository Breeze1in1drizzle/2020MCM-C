Excellent dryer for the price! I've owned Hot Tools and other Conair dryers in the past, and so far this one has been the best. I bought this one to replace my older model Conair dryer that went out after 4 years of use. I really like that this one has the switch for the cool setting, rather than having to hold the blue button to get the cold blast (although it still has that button as an option). It's not as quiet as my last dryer, but my hair gets dryer faster without drying out the ends or creating static. My hair actually looks more shiny/silky after using this one than it did with the older model.
