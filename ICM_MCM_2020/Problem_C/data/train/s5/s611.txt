I got this as a second hair-dryer for traveling and to leave at my boyfriend's house so I didn't have to lug my Conair 213X Infiniti Pro (about $40, and much heavier than this one) back and forth every weekend.  This was a great choice.  The dryer is much much lighter than what I'm used to and has a nice smooth feel (as in, it doesn't feel light plastic under my hands, but more of a rubbery-feel - very pleasant!).  It is also just as powerful as the 213x.  It has 2 speeds (gale-force wind and normal), and 3 heat settings.  I use the gale-force winds on medium heat and my hair 4-5 below my shoulder, thin-medium thickness, is dry in under 3 minutes.  My younger sister tried it out and put it on gale-force high heat and she said it didn't stay on for more than a few seconds.  My thoughts are it could have been my outlet (I live in a very old apartment building - circa 1900s) unable to handle the current flow OR it could have been a safety feature of the hair dryer to prevent over-heating.  Either way its not a problem for me since high heat hurts my head and ears and makes me feel as if I'm destroying my hair!  All-in-all its a great value for the price.
