sometimes it's the small things that are the most impressive. case in point, the glow in the dark feature on this little paci's! i thought it was a &#34;nice idea&#34; when i purchased them, only to realize that the practicality of them with my new little 4 week old newborn is awesome!!! i didn't realize how difficult it was for me to see at night when his paci is in his mouth, or if he's spit it out or pulled it out with his fist while sleeping. now i can quickly see if it's in his mouth. it glows just as bright as the photos show, if it is charged up in bright light (flashlight, cell phone, etc) prior to putting it in the baby's mouth. otherwise, it produces a very dim, low glow. you'd think that it's too low to see, until your eyes adjust to the dark at night, then you can see it clearly. the case they come in are able to have a little water added to the bottom and placed into the microwave to kill all germs on them. i personally like to clean them myself with hot soapy water, but that's just me. and they also have the same nipples as the mam pacifiers that we received in the hospital, which prevents nipple confusion. all around, i really love this little things and will get more if/when we lose either of the two we currently have.
