My daughter loved her newborn soothie, but after reading about the dangers of babies choking on them (the material is flimsy enough to bend them in half and shove in a mouth) I didn't want her to have the newborn one anymore.  She was four or five months when we switched and she did NOT like these.  They are more firm and heavier. They would fall out of her mouth and she refused to use them.  I looked everywhere online to find out if most infants have a  hard the adjusting to them and couldn't find any info.  Just wanted to come back and say it took two or three days of using the new ones but she completely adjusted and loves these 3month+ soothies.  I feel better knowing that she is safe with them.  Also they are sturdy enough to teethe on. Hopefully this will give others some hope that even if your child hates them at first, they can grow to love them.
