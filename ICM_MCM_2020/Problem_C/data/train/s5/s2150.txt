This pacifier is worth it's weight in gold. It's genius!  The little giraffe helps to keep the pacifier close to my daughters mouth even if she spits it out, so she is able to put it back in instead of needing to cry for me.<br /><br />At night I put this on her tummy, and so when she wakes her pacifier is right there to help her back to sleep immediately!!<br /><br />A must have for any parent.
