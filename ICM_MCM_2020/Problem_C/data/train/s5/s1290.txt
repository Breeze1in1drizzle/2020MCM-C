This is like no other dryer I've ever owned.  My 5 year old dryer caught fire . After a few quick looks around my rural<br />town for  any kind of dryer,  (Dryers are dryers. Right?), and coming up empty,  I just went online and with little consideration except price, in 5 minutes I just clicked  the buy button & forgot about it.  When it arrived and I used it , it was a force!  My hair dryed  practically instantly and with added volume.  It has many buttons.  Not sure what all are for.  Can't read them without my glasses.<br />Just pushed them all until I get fastest & hotest.  I can use my round brush & this dryer and dry & style my hair faster than with any of my specialty  hair stylers. Just a few minutes. ( I have shortish hair)  I've got the &#34;Instyler&#34; $100+  & The Pefecter Fusion Styler $100+  & others.  I can't pinpoint why this one works better in lightening speed.... (  I think it was $20 or $30.)....  but it does.  Do yourself a big favor & look no further.  It's no gamble at all. With Amazon you can return it.
