These are excellent pacifiers that held up well and were the only kind my super colicky baby would take. Also, they aren't terribly expensive, so we were able to stock up. Being able to stick your finder in the sucking area is helpful in getting the baby to take it and is great for freezing water in when your little one is teething (which happened at 2 1/2 months for us). Highly recommended!
