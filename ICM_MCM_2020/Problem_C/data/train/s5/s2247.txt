I am a nurse and this is the paci that is used in many of the hospitals I have worked in and this was the paci of choice at the hospial my twins were born in. The paci did not deter my twins from breastfeeding and it does not leave those awful marks on their faces that some of the other pacifiers do. This is the ONLY paci I will use and have two in every room of my home and 4-6 of them in my diaper bag!!!!
