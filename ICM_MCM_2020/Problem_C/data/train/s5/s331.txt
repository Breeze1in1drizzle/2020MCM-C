My daughter purchased this and because she wanted something cheap and in-expensive but with good quality. This was perfect. It came with the Concentrator. The one negative thing I have to say is that my daughter would've liked to have something like the Universal Finger Diffuser. Other then that it has really nice settings Low Med and High with a cooler button and it isn't very heavy.
