This is one sweet Hairdryer, stylish, well made and looks well built. I got the whole family to try this out and everyone likes it.<br /><br />They loved the attachment that helps with frizzled hair and another attachment that seems to give a flat blast out of the dryer.<br />It has great controls, hot and warm, with three speed for the fan. It can also be used to blow cold air with a trigger type button under the blower section.<br />The cable is long enough and also worth mentioning is the neat box it came in. The style is quite interesting but not overdone and it sure catches the eyes of my kids friends who frequently come over to help each other with their hair styles.<br /><br />I am quite pleased with this hair dryer, it does what it should with ease, style and power!
