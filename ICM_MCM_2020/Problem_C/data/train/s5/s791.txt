I bought this a few months ago and decided to go ahead and just now review it after months of using it.  I love it.  I had one of these growing up and I didn't know they still made hair dryers like these.  It does take a tad bit longer to dry your hair, but if you are wanting to straighten your hair you know it takes time to get that look.  It fits well in my hand.  It's not too heavy.  I don't use the comb attachments.  A lot of people complain about the brush attachment, but I guess they never used one growing up and know the trick with the brush.  No it doesn't grab onto your hair like a regular brush does since it's so soft AND because the air is blowing your hair away from the brush itself.  I put my hand on the other side of my hair.  So I have the hairdryer with the brush attached on one side. the hair in the middle (of course) and I have my hand on the other side to keep the hair pressed into the bristles.
