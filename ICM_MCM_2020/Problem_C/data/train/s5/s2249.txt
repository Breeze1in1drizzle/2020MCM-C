I absolutely love this pacifier. They are easy to hold onto. When I need to be hands free I just stick the little tab in my mouth haha. Also the little hole in the middle is convenient. When my son is first trying to latch onto it I can put my finger in that and help him get a better grip on it. It's also really funny to look at. Lasst but not least, they are the only types of pacifier that my son will use. He loves them! They're a lifesaver for me.
