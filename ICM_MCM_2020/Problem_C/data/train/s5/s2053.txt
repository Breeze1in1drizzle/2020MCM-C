We used the Soothie pacifiers until my daughter had her tongue and lip tie released at 8 weeks. After that procedure, she just didn't like any pacifiers any more. I've tried 5 different types and she hates them all. :(<br /><br />Sounds like a dream but sometimes it's nice to have something that soothes her other than breastfeeding.<br /><br />I read an article on these pacis and immediately ordered a set. Yes, I received the blue and red pacis instead of the more girly ones, but I don't care. They're pefect! She loves them! At 6 months when we're already dealing with sleep regression issues and a new tooth (and one more on the way) I'm thrilled that these provide comfort.<br /><br />I'm ordering two more sets now so we're not without them.<br /><br />Also, I can't seem to find these in local stores. They have the oval ones but they're not the orthodontic ones. Amazon is the only place I can find these softflex ortho pacis for 6+ month olds.
