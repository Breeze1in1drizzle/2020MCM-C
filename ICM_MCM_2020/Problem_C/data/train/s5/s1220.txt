I purchased this hair dryer for my wife who happens to be a professional hair stylist, and I would say that she is very selective (picky) about the products she uses. For her work, similar hair dryers sell for almost $200. Consequently, I thought this was a very good buy. At any rate, so far she loves this product. She uses it at home and has nothing but compliments about the dryer. She even suggested that we should buy one for each of our two daughters for Christmas. So far, a very happy customer!
