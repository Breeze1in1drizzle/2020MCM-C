These pacifiers are so great, they are the only ones my little guy will use!<br />perfect for car trips because they don't fall behind them in the seat when they spit them out.<br />Especially when he gets upset in the car he hugs onto the stuffed animal part, and it clams him down.<br />also it's much esier to find in the diaper bag than those tiny pacifers that fall to the bottom and get all gross.<br />my advice is get several... and keep in every room!
