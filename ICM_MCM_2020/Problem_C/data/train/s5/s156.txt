This is a great unit to organize the bathroom. I'm not a fan of stowing the hair dryer away in a cabinet or drawer and taking it out for every use and I'm not a fan of having it sit on the counter all of the time. This is a great compromise. The unit is always ready to use and it doesn't take up space. Also, I am not able to mount this in studs, so I was concerned that the constant off and on might loosen this unit on the wall. There's no problem with that. I even bought an extra one for my kids' bathroom--and you know how kids can be rough. Both units are fine and show no sign of loosening. Lastly, it's easy to install. Love that part. I highly recommend this product.
