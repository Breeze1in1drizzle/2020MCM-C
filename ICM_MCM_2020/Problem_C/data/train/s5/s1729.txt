I am a stay at home dad and will only put up with things that work. This one works very well. You want it warmer, you add more water next time. You want it cooler, you add less. A monkey could not mess this one up.<br /><br />I cannot understand the negative rankings. Easy to use, easy to clean! If some junk gets in it, fill it up with some water and heat it, swirl it around and wipe it with a paper towel. It takes 20 seconds!<br /><br />Whoever said it does not shut off automatically is wrong. The burner will stay warm after you use it. Just like a stove does. But it DOES shut off. I leave mine plugged in all day everday. Only an idiot would leave a bottle on the warmer for more than 15 minutes anyway. What the heck are you heating it for, if you are not going to use it? Sheesh.<br /><br />Get this one. It is inexpensive and it works. Bottom line.
