After 18 years, I found myself looking for a new hair dryer.  I had been interested in the 'ions' I'd seen on many packages.  This is a very nice hair dryer, it came with both a diffuser and a concentrator which snap on nicely and work well, as designed.  It dries my hair very quickly even on the low setting, and I like how the intake is on the back rather than the sides and is less likely to draw longer hair into it.  Supposedly, you can remove that part for cleaning, but I haven't figured out how.<br /><br />Overall, a really awesome product, especially for the price.
