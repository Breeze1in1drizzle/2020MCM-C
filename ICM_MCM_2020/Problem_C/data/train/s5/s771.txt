Nice quality, you get what you pay for. It's efficient and the temperature options as nice. I use the diffuser all the time for my curly hair to avoid frizzing and it locks on nicely. Also, the diffuser is nicely shaped so you can get it right on your scalp because it is curved, and it won't fall off all the time like it might with another brand. Make sure you don't click the blue button unless you want it locked on the cold temperature -- I almost thought I had a defective product because I didn't know I had clicked it by accident. Otherwise it's working great so far.
