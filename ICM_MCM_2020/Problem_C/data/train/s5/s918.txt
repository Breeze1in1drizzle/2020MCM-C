Searched high and low for a good quality,  stylish and affordable hair dryer. This is perfect....<br />I've had it a while now (over a year) and I am still happy to have found this.  I really love the folding handle and retracting cable with the push of a button - allows me to pack it away nice and easily.  Everything else works as described.
