I ordered this dryer to replace a &#34;Vidal Sassoon&#34; branded hot comb/dryer that had served me well for many years.  I wanted it because I really like the &#34;hot comb&#34; style.  After receiving it and noting the similarities with my old unit I would bet that Andis manufactured the dryer for Vidal Sassoon.  Not only was the design almost identical, but the comb and brush attachments were identical and, in fact, would interchange perfectly with my old unit.  If that is the case, this one should also last for many trouble free years.  It does have one design feature that caused some initial confusion.  The unit has three heat settings but there are only two fan speeds.  The fan operates at the same speed on both medium and high heat settings which makes it appear that the switch is not doing anything.  A check with my ammeter revealed, however, that the electrical load does increase a few amps and the air does get hotter in the high position.  I am not saying that this is any kind of a problem, but I just thought it unusual since my old one had three fan speeds.<br /><br />I would personally question the part about the &#34;ionic&#34; feature &#34;breaking up water molecules&#34; to accelerate drying but the ad writers gotta have something to do.<br /><br />At any rate, it was just what I was looking for and does a great job.
