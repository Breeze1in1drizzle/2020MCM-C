I first bought this hair dryer because of the positive reviews left by other reviewers with thick hair. In the morning, I don't want to spend 20 minutes just making sure my hair is dry before I leave. I want some time to style, too.<br /><br />This hair dryer has a professional quality motor (1875 watt AC motor) which translates to stronger air flow, hotter air, and less drying time. That's exactly what I wanted and that's what I got. This hairdryer, with the airflow concentrator attachment, dried my hair in under 7 minutes, which is unheard of for me. It has 3 heat settings, 2 fan speeds, and a cool air shot button.<br /><br />BONUS: This hair dryer is quieter than a lot of others I've owned. It's still a hair dryer, so it'll make noise, but this one's noises are hushed.<br /><br />Besides its speedy drying, it's just a really pretty hair dryer. It's got an attractive black matte finish that's soft to the touch. It also features pretty pink pearlescent buttons and accents.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: I recommend this hair dryer to those who are looking for a quiet, yet powerful hair dryer to streamline their morning routine.
