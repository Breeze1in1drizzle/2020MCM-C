I suggest you don't waste your cash on those expensive hair dryers when you can buy this one.  It comes in the ceramic/tourmaline design that is popular now, but more importantly, this dryer's wattage is much higher than most hair dryers out there (and I've looked!).  The higher the wattage, the more air it can move around...and that means faster dry times.  I've only used this a couple of times, so I don't know how long it will last.  So far, so good.
