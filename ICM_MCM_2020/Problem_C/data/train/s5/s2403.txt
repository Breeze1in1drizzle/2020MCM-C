My husband bought these at Walmart once right when our daughter was born and we havent been able to find them again. They are FANTASTIC. They snap shut when they hit the floor so they dont get all nasty and dirty. Super lazy parents might be turned off by them because sometimes you have to open it back up for your baby to stick it back in their mouth.<br />My daughter only likes these pacifiers and parents always ask me where to get them!
