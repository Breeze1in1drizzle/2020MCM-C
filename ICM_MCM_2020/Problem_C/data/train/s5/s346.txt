I was very skeptical of spending so much on a hair dryer.  After reading the great reviews, I figured I would give it a try and hope for the best. I was so eager to try it this morning that I didn't even let my hair partially air dry like I normally do!!  I have never timed how long it takes to dry my hair as I take my time, do part, get tired and come back to it, etc.  My hair is super thick and longish (past my shoulders by a few inches.)  SO, I start to dry my hair and not only did it seem that it dried much faster, but I was able to get it SO much straighter than with my cheapo ionic dryer that I had been using previously.  I usually dry as well as I can and then have to spend another 10 minutes with the iron to smooth out the mess.  I only used the iron for a small section in the back that I hadn't hit well enough with the dryer.  My husband even commented that my hair looked pretty today (I didn't tell him I bought a new dryer!!!!)
