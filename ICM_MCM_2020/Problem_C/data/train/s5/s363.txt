Arrived promptly, packaged well - and works great!  Perfect heat (doesn't fry your hair), nice attachments for directing heat to specific areas (I have very, very thick hair), great cord length, and perfect weight. This is a very simple, easy to use, and effective hair dryer at a nice price. I love it!
