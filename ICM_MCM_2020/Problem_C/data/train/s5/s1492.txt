I've had this a relatively short time so my review is subject to update. the controls require a little reading to understand but other than that this is like something from the kitchen of the future. The automatic pop out / pop in is smooth and quiet. The power is sufficient to get the job done quickly and the microwaves are dispersed so there are no hot spots.
