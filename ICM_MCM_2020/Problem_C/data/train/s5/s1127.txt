I think they are calling it a Mangroomer since it looks really cool. The grip is nice and feels solid to hold. The hairdryer itself does the job well and dries the hair fast. It has various heat, speed settings, a cool air button. I loved the power on this and it isn't too loud at the same time. You can also use the attachment but for me it worked well without it as well. The red and black combo really looks nice. I do recommend this hairdryer for the price and the power it delivers!
