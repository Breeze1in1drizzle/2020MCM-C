When I first opened this hair dryer, I was quite dismayed!  It was much smaller than I expected - so small in fact that I doubted that it would work at all.  Last night I washed my hair and decided to try out this &#34;mini toy&#34;.  I was truly amazed;  while it didn't dry my hair quite as quickly as my large tourmaline dryer, it worked nearly as quickly.  For travel, you can't go wrong with this dryer!
