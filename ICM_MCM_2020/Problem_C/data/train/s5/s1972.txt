This was the only pacifier that would stay in because it would lie on his tummy and because he wasn't rolling it would stay in.  He has this one and the puppy. The puppy looks cuter than the monkey in my opinion - but both have served their purpose and get a lot of comments from people too. Very cute. Easy to wash - just throw in the washing machine. Very happy with these and definitely recommend.
