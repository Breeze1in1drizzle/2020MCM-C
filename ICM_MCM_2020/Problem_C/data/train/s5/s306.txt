As I had minimal space on our bathroom  counter I needed a hair dryer that could hang out of the way.  I was able to attach it to the inside of the cabinet door below.  Thus it is out of sight when not in use and very available when needed.  As far as the function of the dryer, it lives up to my expectations.
