I was so tired of wimpy hairdryers that I had to buy this hairdryer after reading the other reviews.  The reviews are CORRECT.  The air that comes out of this dryer is incredible -- it dries my hair quickly, but the nice thing is that it dries your hair with air and not by baking it with intense heat-- it is hot, but not scorching.  A great purchase!
