I dry my hair almost every day as my hair is rather long. This little beauty does its job, and does it well. There are plenty of settings and options to choose from, depending on what you want and what is best for your hair. I have no complaints whatsoever.<br /><br />Update: It's been several months now, and I still use this product almost every day, and it still works great. This is easily the best hairdryer I've ever purchased - strong, fast, and definitely good quality!
