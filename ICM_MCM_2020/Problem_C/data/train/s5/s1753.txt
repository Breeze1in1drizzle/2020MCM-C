I bought this for my son and people LOVE it! I am asked all the time where I bought it from cuz they want to get it for their grandchild, niece, nephew...ect I often think Amazon should pay me for the amount of word of mouth I have given on this product... I think if you have a sense of humor and don't see it as some slam against humanity (as some reviewer has) than you'll love it, I think if you do have a problem with it you probably aren't even bothering looking at the product page and or its reviews.
