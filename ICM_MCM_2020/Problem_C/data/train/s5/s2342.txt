These are the only pacifiers my kids would/will take. They love them and I've tried several others and they refuse them. One thing I don't like is that I feel like junk gets caught in or around the actual pacifier part that goes in their mouth and that disgusts me. . . I try to keep it clean but it's just one more thing to remember and I wish it could be designed so that it wasn't so hard to clean. I worry about what gets inside it as I've seen water in there and have no way of getting it out. Otherwise, I love them because my kids love them. :)
