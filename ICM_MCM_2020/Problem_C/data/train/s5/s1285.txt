I was looking to replace my hair dryer but didn't want to spend over a hundred dollars for it.  I checked with Amazon and the Onei MK-II hair dryer was featured for less than half that price.  I figured if it wasn't that good I would keep it as a back up.  I am happy to report that this is a wonderful hair dryer. It works without the heat burning your scalp and it is more quiet than most hair dryers. My hair retains water and usually takes a long time to dry but this hair dryer does it faster.  I use this hair dryer every day and will order another for my beach house.  Another good quality is that for a full-size hair dryer, it is lighter than most.
