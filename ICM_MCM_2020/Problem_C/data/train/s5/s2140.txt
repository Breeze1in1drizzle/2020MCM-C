These are adorable and effective. It does a great job of keeping the binky in my son's mouth while he sleeps. He has even managed to get it in there himself a time or two. He also likes to play with it. I was so happy when I found this and even happier when it worked so well. Strangers have commented about how cute and great it is as well.
