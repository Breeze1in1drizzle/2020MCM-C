I love my hot pink mini-pro, so lightweight and Powerful!  The super cute tote bag is a plus!  Perfect for travel but I use mine everyday.  I didn't think it would be as good as my big, clunky, heavy dryer, but this little baby gets HOT, has a lower setting also.  I have shoulder/ hand issues and now they don't hurt when I blow dry my hair!  Love it!!
