After reading a previous post I bought the holder thinking it would only carry 1 pacifier.  I was very pleased to see it fits 2! (see costumer images) I am using newborn size and I have no clue how much bigger the shields are on size 2 and 3, so I can not say with certainty that they will fit.  However, after shaking it around, the pacifiers had room to change positions, so I hope that means anything a bit bigger will also fit.      It is very cute and seems sturdy. I first hit it against my hand, then tried it against the table and desk top. All 3 times the container has stayed shut. It gives me more confidence that I can hook it on my diaper bag or purse with it surviving the day intact (and more importantly, that I did not loose a pacifier!)
