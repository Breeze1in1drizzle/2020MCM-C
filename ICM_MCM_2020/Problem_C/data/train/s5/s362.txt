I have had a yellow bird blow dryer since 1976. I replaced mine 7/2011 (35 years).  So you can see this powerful, durable, and efficient dryer is worth it's money and more.  I think I spent $15.00 on it back in '76 and that averages out to be $.43 cents per year for my investment.  No wonder it is hard (or non-existent) to find in beauty stores, online, and on Conair's website (it is not available on their website).    I love all of the settings from cold to very hot.  It comes with a comb (I don't use it anymore since I have dreadlocks) and a muzzle that narrows at the tip.      I would also recommend this model to any beauty salon because it holds up.
