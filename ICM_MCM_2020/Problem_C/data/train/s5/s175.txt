I am so entirely pleased with this hair dryer that I'm coming back for another one... 2 1/2 years later. I've burned through cheaper, store-bought hair dryers in the past. I bought an Andis many years ago and it was wonderful, so I bought this model in June 2009, and sadly today in December 2011 it finally fizzled out.<br /><br />The dryer works extremely quickly. I remember comparing it to the past model I had, and the reason I've stuck with Andis since because of their efficiency (and longevity). I have naturally loose-curly hair, and I use this dryer daily to straighten my hair with a round brush. It allows my hair to retain a lot of body, come out super-soft, and avoid frizz!<br /><br />While the switches on the handle are kind of in a bad place, I eventually got used to it and rarely do I accidentally turn it off. It's not hard to turn back on, so I don't see it as that big of an issue.<br /><br />I've had great customer service experience with Andis in the past as well. The plastic piece that holds the filter on the back of the dryer (at the air intake) broke and no longer functioned. I also broke one of the attachments. I called their customer service number and they replaced both items free of charge, even though I'd had the dryer for more than a year!
