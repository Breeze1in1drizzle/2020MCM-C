I love my mam products, they are so easy to clean and the microwave sanitation was a life saver when we went on vacations since almost every hotel has a microwave and I didn't have to bring along things to clean them with. They have held up very nice over the last almost eight months my daughter has used them. She loved these bottles straight from the start even with me breast feeding at first she took these right away. They do leak often, but I have come to realize it's almost impossible to find a bottle that doesn't leak. I also use the pacifiers by mam and she loved those as well.
