WE USED THIS HAIR DRYER IN A HOTEL ONCE AND LOVED IT SO MUCH WE HAVE ONE IN EVER BATHROOM (7) IN THE HOUSE...  WE LIVE AT THE BEACH SO WHEN WE HAVE COMPANY THEY USE THE HAIR DRYERS AND THEY LOVE THEM..  TWO OF OUR FRIENDS LIKED THEM SO MUCH THEY BOUGHT ONE FOR THEIR HOUSES.......  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THE HAIR DRYER WITH THE NIGHT LIGHT, THE LIGHT WON'T LAST LONG, JUST BUY THIS ONE IT'S THE BEST........
