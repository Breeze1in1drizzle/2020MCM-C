This is our second wubbanub (our dogs finally got to the other after 4 months). We love this thing.  Our baby was given a soothie at the hospital but we needed a way to keep it off the floor. This thing is a great solution. It is easy to spot across the room. When she spits the pacifier out it will usually just sit on her chest and she can sometimes get it back in on her own even without hands. Now that she is getting older she really seems to like the animal more and more. She pets it to soothe herself to sleep and now that she is interested in toys, she always has one near (even when we forget all her other toys). I have never tried any other pacifiers, but if your baby is a soothie baby, then the wubba nub is the way to go!
