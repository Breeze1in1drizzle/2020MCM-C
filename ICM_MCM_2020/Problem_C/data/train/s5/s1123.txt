This is a sturdy, high-quality hair dryer.  It has all the features that my own hair dryer comes with. It has multiple heat settings, multiple speed settings, a cool blast button, an ionization button you can toggle on and off, and a removable end-cap you can use to focus the airflow.  It has good speed, nice heat, and durability.  It doesn't overheat and it dries hair very quickly, even longer hair like mine.  The only thing about this hair dryer that makes it a mangroomer is its appearance.  It looks like a power tool, so no man will be embarrassed to hang it in his bathroom where guests might see it.  In my home, my teens are using it.  It's a great hair dryer, for men or women.
