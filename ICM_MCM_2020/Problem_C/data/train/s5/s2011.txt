We bought the wubbunub so it would stay on our sons chest while he was in his car seat. It didn't really work for that until he was around 3 months. Then the wubbunub became his best friend!!! It was a security blanket and binky all in one. The best part is that it has the soothie pacifier on it (which was the brand he loved).<br />Pros:<br />- Easy to find in a bag because its bigger than a regular binky.<br />- Easy for a baby to find when they want their binky.<br />- Easy to wash: I just threw it in the wash when I washed his clothes.<br />- You can easily seam rip the binky off when you're ready to wean the binky and your child can still have their security toy.
