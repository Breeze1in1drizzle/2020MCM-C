This microwave came with my apartment (mine is model JVM1540DM4WW, but it looks identical to this one), and it totally blew away my expectations of what a good microwave should be. It cooks quickly and evenly (everything takes about half as long as it did in my old microwave), the button options are good (I use the Express Cook buttons all the time), the bright and dim surface light options are nice, the shelf inside is pretty cool (even though I never cook that much at once), and I think it looks great in the kitchen (the rest of the kitchen is wonderful white and metal IKEAness). It's gotten a lot of use over the past year, and it's still performing just like new. I was surprised to see the negative reviews here, as I would absolutely buy another one of these.
