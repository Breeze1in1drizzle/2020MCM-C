[[asin:b002kar786 nuk silicone orthodontic nipples, slow flow, size 1, 2 pack]]  i feed my baby breast milk (medela pumping) and similac advance newborn (ready to feed, 2-fluid ounces). i was using the disposable nipple from similac for the medela bottle, too, but it was too wasted. so i was looking for a nipple fits to the similac ring (i'm not sure this is medela narrow or wide size ring.), and has slow flow.   this nuk nipple fits perfectly to the similac ring. i removed the disposable nipple from the ring and inserted the nuk nipple. perfect! my baby sucks this nipple as she sucks breast milk. it is definitely slow flow.
