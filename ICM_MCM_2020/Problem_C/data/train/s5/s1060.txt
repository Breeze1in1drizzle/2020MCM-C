So I hadn't updated my hair dryer in years (think 15), so I was really thrilled to receive this one. I would highly recommend it!!!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Doesn't die on me when I am using it (overheating). This is a big one for me. I have very long hair and it seems every blower would take a water break halfway through because it was being worked too much. Not this one!<br /><br />Nice, modern look. LOVE the spunky metallic green color, not gaudy at all!<br /><br />Small, lightweight size.  MUCH smaller than the older one I had, and not nearly as heavy. Your hand won't fall off after using it! :)<br /><br />Usable Attachment.  I wasn't aware when I bought this, but it has an attachment on the end to focus the heat for styling. Since I have hair that curves in and frames the face, this is PERFECT for getting that look!  I only have to go over it once in order for it to be perfect.<br /><br />Hot and Cold.  The cold is actually NOT hot. Yes, it's not hot! Amazing! LOL  And the hot doesn't burn your eyelashes off!  Perfect in either setting, even the cooler version actually still dries your hair well!<br /><br />Negatives: None that I can think of!<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend it! Great blow dryer!
