wow!!! incredibly fast shipping from Mix Wholesale. I ordered it on Thursday..it arrived on Saturday (and I live in Georgia). put it together in less than 20 minutes and powered it up! So easy to assemble!! Can't wait to use this on my 4b/c natural hair!! will update again after more use.<br /><br />Update: This dryer is fantastic!! Dried my freshly washed, dense, chin length 4b/c hair in about 40 minutes! on medium heat!! I did not need neck covers or ear protectors at all. I have a pic of the size rollers I used; they fit with AMPLE space under the hood. It's also very quiet--I had no trouble having a conversation on my phone; easily watched television. I haven't had to duct tape anything, it's pretty sturdy, a little wobbly, but not I'm not moving around a lot if I'm sitting under the dryer anyway..<br /><br />Basically, I love it and I'm SO GLAD i didn't waste my money on a Pibb or PEBCO brand. I don't own a salon, but it's great for home use and is a million times better than standing in front of my mirror trying to dry my hair with a handheld blowdryer.
