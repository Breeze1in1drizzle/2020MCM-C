Our 3 month old LOVES her lambie! We always have it with us and she even holds onto it when she doesn't want the binky in her mouth. The little legs make it easy for her to grab onto... It's a nice little security item for her. Obviously a plus that lambie helps to keep the binky from falling to the ground.
