I had the perfect blowdryer... that was until I moved. Nonetheless, I was pretty worried about getting a new one. I have been through a fair share of terrible no good hair dryers. Looove this one! It's lightweight, only 1.7 lbs compared to some that are 2.5 or even 3! I like that it has a retractable cord, which will make for easier traveling. That goes for the folding handle as well. The HIGH is actually really high powered, I was surprised. And the settings are perfect, in my opinion; the warm isn't too hot (like some I've experienced).
