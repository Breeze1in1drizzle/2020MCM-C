Just used my new hair dryer for the first time and ran, yes--ran, to write this review.  I cannot believe this is my hair!  I have shoulder-length, course, thick, curly hair which I blow dry and iron.  I have always used high-end hair dryers, but this is the best ever.  Worth twice the price!  Not only did my hair dry faster, but it dried frizz-free.  I did not have to flat iron it after blowing it dry.  First time ever not having to flat iron.  My hair looks like it does when I come from the hair dresser.  I can't believe a hair dryer can make this big of a difference, but I can assure you, it does.  Thank you Sedu.  I am a believer.
