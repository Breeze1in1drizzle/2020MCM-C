Infants notoriously spit out pacifiers - it's a fact.<br />We love the Wubbanub because it positions the pacifier in such a way that my daughter can stop sucking for a moment and it does not fall out and roll away.<br />At 14 weeks old, she will now slurp on the legs, tail and head of this thing and is learning to put the pacifier back in on her own - Don't leave home without it!!! :)
