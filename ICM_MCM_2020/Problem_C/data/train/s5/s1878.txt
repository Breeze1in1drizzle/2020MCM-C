My son had a heart condition when he was born, so when he was released from the NICU he had to go to the cardiologists where he had many tests completed.  When we were there, they gave him a vanilla scented soothie.  While I personally hate the soothie since it covers up their entire face, it was a save all!  He was so angry at the doctors, that this calmed him right down.  By the end of his visit he was asleep.  When I researched the soothie, I came across these and so far he loves them.  For whatever reason he favors the blue over the orange, but loves them both.  When he's super fussy, we give him these and he tends to calm down faster. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
