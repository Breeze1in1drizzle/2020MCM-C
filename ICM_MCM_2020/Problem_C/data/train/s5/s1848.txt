Love this pacifier/teether. My 7 month NEVER used a pacifier but needs to SUCK on something. This thing is HUGE...he doesn't really use it like a pacifier to suck on the nipple part, he just sucks on all the parts! It's great because every piece of this is suckable!! He totally grabs for this all the time and it's not a choking hazard because it's so big. I bought two of them!
