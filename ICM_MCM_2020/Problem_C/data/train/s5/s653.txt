I love this blow dryer, I bought it because it's the one that the lady at the salon uses.  It gets really hot fast and it has four heat settings (low-cold, high-cold, low-hot, high-hot).  I use it with a round bristle brush and it staightens my thick curly hair in less than half an hour and leaves lots of volume.  You won't regret buying it.
