When I had my baby, we used the pacifier provided by the hospital (Avent Soothie) I noticed that the pacifier would go flying out of his mouth quite frequently. I did a lot of research on pacifiers and found out that the Avent Soothie is terrible for a babies developing mouth and can lead to many dental and orthodontic issues down the road. After my research, I decided to go with these and they are amazing. They are designed to fit your babies mouth properly. I will NEVER get another kind of pacifier. It never flies across the room when he is trying to suckle on it...hwill sleep all night with this in his mouth and have no issues. You should definitely get this over any other pacifier on the market.
