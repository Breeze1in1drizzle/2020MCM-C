We have been very pleased with all Dr. Brown's products. We have their bottles, bottle warmer, pacifiers, and more. With our second child on the way we decided to stick with what we were used to and happy with. My daughter is 15 months and only uses the Dr. Brown's pacifiers when she is napping or sleeping, never had an issue with her not liking this brand.
