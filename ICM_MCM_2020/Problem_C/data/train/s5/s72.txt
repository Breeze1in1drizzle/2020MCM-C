I purchased the Conair Wallmount Dryer because we absolutely wore out our last one and we loved that one so much that we bought another.  I have these hairdryers in both of our bathrooms and they are so handy because they are right there.  Just pick it up and turn it on and you are ready to go.  Great product.
