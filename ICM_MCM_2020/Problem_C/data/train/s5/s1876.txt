My son loves these pacifiers! When he was newborn, I could spread the legs out on top of his little swaddled body and it would help keep the pacifier in his mouth and help him find it again easily before he was able to use his hands. In the Car, it is MUCH easier to find when you can't see (for example, searching the crib in a dark room or with one hand reaching to carseat in the back while driving). He did go through a short phase when he was learning to grasp where he would pull it out of his mouth and not be able to get it back in, but as he got older it because much easier for him to put these back in at night without waking up.
