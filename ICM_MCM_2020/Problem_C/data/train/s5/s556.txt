This hair dryer was to replace my wife's previous Conair travel hair dryer. This one is a little noisier than her old one, but is by no means a problem noise-wise. It still is much quieter than many she has used in the past.'<br /><br />The dryer drys her hair well and quickly. Plus it was a great price on Amazon.
