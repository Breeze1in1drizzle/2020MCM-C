We are total fans of this pacifier!! Things we love about it: the pacifier stays put in the baby's mouth longer, it's easy for the baby to grab, it doesn't fall as often, it's cute, the baby can suck on the pacifier or the doll, and it's easy to find.  We is easy to wash.  Everyday we wash it with soap and water, then we have the paci part sit in a bowl of hot boiling water.  Once in a while, I put it in a basket and put it in the wash.  We got two as a baby shower gift and bought another one just in case.
