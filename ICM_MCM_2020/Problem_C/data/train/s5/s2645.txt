We used Tomme Tippee bottles for my third born, my sister is now pregnant and we have gotten her all the Tommee Tippee closer to nature bottles, and now the pacifiers. I love that these make the transitions from bottle to pacifier easier, and she already loves the brand Tomme Tippee.<br /><br />I received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my personal and unbiased review.
