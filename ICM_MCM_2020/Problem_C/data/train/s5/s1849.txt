My nephew is 7 months old and from birth he used the Soothie pacifier and loved it so when he started teething, I wanted to get him something similiar to what he was using and this was perfect, he loves to put things in his mouth and the texture of this is great, although he dosen't like to use it as a pacifier, the nipple is different.
