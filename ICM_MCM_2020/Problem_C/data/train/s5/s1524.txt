Had large amount of rust under rotating plate in GE microwave.  Surface prep is important.  I started out with sandpaper and discovered this was going to take too long due to the amount of rust I had.  I ended up using a 1&#34; metal paint scraper to remove all paint/rust down to base metal in the damaged area, this worked very well.  Then sanded smooth.  Wiped surface clean with rubbing alcohol. Masked off area to be painted.  Ensure adequate ventilation when painting.  I applied mutliple coats.  2 months of usage thus far... looks great, holding up great!
