I am in hotel industry - I could buy thousands of these. Super cheap, very quiet, with a nice night light, barely use any electricity, great heat, simple to use, VERY comfortable in hand. I've never seen a guest use their own brought hair-dryer. they ALWAYS elect to use this - and it's obviously installed very conveniently in the bathroom - good screws and installation instructions that come with it. Never falls off, always there when you need your hair fluffy.
