I love this. The cord is on the right, and short, I could have used the word on the left but other than that (because of my outlet location) it deserves a full 5 stars. It does reach to my outlet, but would have been nicer on the left for the location I have the microwave. Other than that, I love this little microwave, I do have too cook things 30-60 seconds longer however, the space I save it worth the extra cooking time. Heats up food, frozen vegetables, and makes small bagged popcorn perfectly. Fits a full sized plate or paper plate, fits a 10&#34; bowl about 5 inches high and that leaves some space too the top. This is not for cooking meals, small things only in my opinion and just what I needed and wanted.
