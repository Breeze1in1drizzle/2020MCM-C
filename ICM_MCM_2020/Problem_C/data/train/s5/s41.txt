I couldn't believe I had found such a great quality product for a great price. I was in the market for a new hair dryer but couldn't afford to spend an arm and a leg on a fancy blow dryer. I did a lot of shopping around and finally came across this one that even came with the attachments I was looking for. I bought it and was worried that for the price the product wouldn't be as described. I received it and it has 3 different heat settings and two different levels. It also came with the attachments which work great! This blow dryer is still going great a few months down the road. If you are in the market for a new hair dryer and want one that is functional I definitely recommend this product.
