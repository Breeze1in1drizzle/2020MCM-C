This item was recommended to me by a friend. I thought it was very silly, now I don't know if we could live without it! I am ordering another one just in case this one gets lost. It helps keep the binky in my daughters mouth, but also she likes to stroke the arms and legs and seems to find it comforting. It also makes it much easier to find in the diaper bag without taking everything out of the bag in a mad search for a binky. I will buy one for every baby shower I go to from now on.
