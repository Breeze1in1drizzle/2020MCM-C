I bought this because my boyfriend didn't have one and I'm not used to air drying my hair when I shower at his place. He also needed one to dry off his dogs after washing them. I did my research and this one had great reviews and was the cheapest. I thought the item would be bigger but to my surprise it was a portable size so that was even better! The low setting is too low for me and drying my hair on the high setting was perfect. It even has a removable cap on the back for you to clean. For the price I paid, it definitely does its job and dried my hair quick! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!
