I read about the John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer in a magazine, and it has more than lived up to its review.  Dries quickly, leaves hair soft, WITH NO FRIZZIES, and with lots of body.  It's made my wavy, mind-of-its-own hair behave for the first time.  I highly recommend this product.  Couldn't live without it.
