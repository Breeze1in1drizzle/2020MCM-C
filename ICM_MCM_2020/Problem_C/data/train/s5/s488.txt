I love this hair dryer!  It is quiet, there are 3 temperature settings, hot/warm/cold, and 2 speed settings.  I love the retracting cable, which allows for easy uncluttered storage.  I did have to get used to holding it securely while I pressed the button on the side to retract the cable, though, dropping it the first time, because I didn't have a good hold on it.  I had really long hair when I first got it, and then I cut my hair super short recently, so I have yet to figure out how the diffuser works.  I can't wait to try it for some wavier locks once my hair grows out.  This is definitely a good price for a great product!
