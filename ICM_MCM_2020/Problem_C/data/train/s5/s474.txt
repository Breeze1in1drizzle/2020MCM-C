I was actually giddy the first time I used this because of how it made my hair so smooth and full of body.  This baby plus a little mousse work wonders.  My hair is fine and not extremely thick, and this dryer does a great job of giving me extra volume when I want a more glamourous look.  I feel it was worth the splurge, although I'm glad I bought it when I did (a few months ago) because the price has since gone up on it.
