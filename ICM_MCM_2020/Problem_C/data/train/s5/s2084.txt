We started with the Soothie  pacifiers as that is what most people we know have used but our son just didn't like them much and had a hard time keeping it in his mouth. Then we discovered that we had some of the Nuk classics in the basket on the top of a diaper cake that a friend had made, so we cleaned and tried that and he LOVED it! While out of town we wanted an additional pacifier and I picked up one of these Genius pacifiers. At first I thought that the plastic was cheap because it felt so light, but THEN I realized that the lightness factor made it even easier for him to keep this paci in his mouth (gravity was less likely to pull it out). Since it falls out less often, he gets upset when it dissapears less often. And I have never gotten moisture in the nipple, not during washing or in the steam sterilizer. Great pacifier!
