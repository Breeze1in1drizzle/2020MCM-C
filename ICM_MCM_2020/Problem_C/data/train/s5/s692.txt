This is my second Andis hair dryer.  I had the first one over six years but it was starting to wear out.  I wanted to stay with this brand and this one is even better.  Lightweight and easy to hold.  I like the three heat settings which the older one did not have.  More important, styling is better and my hair really does feel silkier and looks shinier.  I recommend this product.
