We love this paci tether!  As with all toys, parents should watch for degradation of materials.  We use this as a tether, not a 'teething' toy.  When I see a crack, I remove the bead, removing just 1 or two beads does not render this tether useless.  I've only lost 1 bead on each of the tethers I own (2).
