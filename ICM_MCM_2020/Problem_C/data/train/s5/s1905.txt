My daughter is a breastfed baby and I was afraid to give her any pacifier at first.  But when the screaming constantly got to be too much, I decided to give this one a try.  Heaven!  She only sucks it for brief periods until she calms down and when she's done, she is DONE, she spits it out with a disgusted look on her face that is too funny.  But it has caused no nipple confusion and it does what it's intended purpose is, stopping the screaming.  Highly recommend!
