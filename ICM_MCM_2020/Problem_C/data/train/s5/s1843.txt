Absolutely LOVE these.  My son latched on from the very beginning with our help by putting our finger into the hole.  I love that it doesn't obstruct his little nose.  He falls asleep sucking on these, and it keeps him calm while I prepare to feed him.  Being a breastfeeding mother, I also feel good about the natural shape of the pacifier.
