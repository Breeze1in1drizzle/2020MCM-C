I got this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. This orthodontic pacifier is tasteless and odor-free silicone nipple that makes an easy transition between pacifier, breast, and bottle. I myself is a breastfeeding mom and I can say that this can make an easy transition from my breast to this pacifier. Although we had several times to try to make him used to it but after several tries he already get used to it. My baby is now very comfortable in using them. It is also easy to clean and sterilize it afterwards. I would definitely recommend this pacifiers to my friends and relatives!
