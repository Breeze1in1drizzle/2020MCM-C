If you are looking for a lightweight dryer that doesn't create hurricane force winds this is the one. My hair is short/medium length and fine. I don't need a mega dryer that sound like an aircraft. This is a compact little thing that fits the bill. It is also a tad quieter than the typical 1875 watt dryer. Two settings high(hot) and low (warm)work great for creating a curl/wave with a round brush. Would recommend for short to medium length fine hair.
