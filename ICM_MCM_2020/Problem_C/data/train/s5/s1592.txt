I needed a microwave that would handle large dinner plates but took no space.  This item fits the bill perfectly.  It fits neatly into a corner of my countertop, in no way dominates the area, and functions way beyond what I expected.  If you are looking for a compact microwave that handles big things this is it.  Don't hesitate to purchase it.  Highly recommended.
