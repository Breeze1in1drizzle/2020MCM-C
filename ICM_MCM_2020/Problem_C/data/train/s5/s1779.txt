If you have an infant, you need a Wubbanub!  I got my first Wubbanub for my son when he was about 6 weeks old.  Honestly, I wish I had it sooner.  This little guy sits perfectly on the baby's chest.  This, of course, leads to more peaceful naps as you are not summoned to find the paci in the middle of the night.  As my son grew, he could start to hold on to the frog part.  He loved it!  He is 8 1/2 months old now and still keeps a Wubbanub in his crib.  It is part stuffed animal, part paci and provides him much comfort through the night.  I wish I could buy these locally, but now that I know about them, I tell all my pregnant friends.  Love the Wubbanub!
