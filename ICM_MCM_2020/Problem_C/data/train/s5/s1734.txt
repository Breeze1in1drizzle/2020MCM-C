I keep buying these for my friends that are expecting.  The ones that use them immediately love them. Babies are soothed and think mom is next to them because of the heart beat recording.  If they wait to give baby the teddy bear then the heart beat doesn't do much and you just have a regular teddy bear, nice but not what we wanted.
