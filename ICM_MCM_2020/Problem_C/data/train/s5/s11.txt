I bought this for my wife when her old one started making a hideous shrieking noise. She is happy with it so far. It doesn't get stupid hot so it doesn't damage her hair. That is important to her. She has never mentioned it feeling heavy so IT'S NOT. Trust me, this 94lb woman asks for help lifting a gallon of milk, so really you should be fine.    I don't know about the ION aspect, I mean it blows hot, dry air. Even the box it came in didn't sound too convinced, using phrases like ions may be emitted, which could possibly make hair shinier. Whatever, it does the job, and doesn't wake the dead.
