Couldn't be more impressed with a blow dryer! The color jumps right out at you; the 2 speeds are average and the heat options work great. Heats up really fast & on high is probably too hot for some. Have medium short hair, so no need for attachments, but I'm sure they would function well if you need them. Can't say enough about the color lol!
