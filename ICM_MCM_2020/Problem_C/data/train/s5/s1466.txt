We got ours three years ago when we redid our appliances and it has been the workhorse of my kitchen.  I cook everything in my microwave and it's so smart it knows how to cook, defrost or reheat everything!  It has been durable and dependable, it's large and versatile.  I have only had to replace a plate (I'm a klutz) and the handle (20-yr-old doesn't know his own strength).  If you want the best microwave ever, get it!
