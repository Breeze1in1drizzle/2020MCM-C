Some of the previous reviewers/buyers were somewhat negative about various aspects of this item.  I personally have used it now for several weeks and can only recommend it to an older less complicated user who doesn't need or want all of the bells and whistles that younger folks seem to find lacking in this product.  Not my take on it and it performs well for me and I use it sometimes several times each day for meals, beverages, snacks etc.  Great value for the money!
