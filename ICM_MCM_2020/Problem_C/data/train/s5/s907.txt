Wow.  This thing is great!<br /><br />No, it's not as powerful or capable as a &#34;full-sized&#34; dryer.  But, what do you expect from something that literally fits in the palm of your hand?  I, myself, expect a lot less than this dryer delivers.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of travel hair dryers, this one locates the fan at the back of the barrel and has some barrel length to it.  This lines the airflow up giving a useful stream of air instead of the every-which-way mess of air that most travel dryers produce.  It's not as directional as a full-sized dryer with a longer barrel, but it's better than most travel dryers.<br /><br />One reviewer reported that the controls are not labeled.  This is not true on the dryer I received.  The Low/Off/High switch and the voltage selector are clearly marked.<br /><br />Several reviewers have complained of it making a very high-pitched motor noise, getting very hot, smelling bad, and then dying.  The unit is shipped set for 125V (USA) power.  While it is true that many modern electronic devices have &#34;auto-ranging&#34; or &#34;universal&#34; AC inputs and work properly on any line voltage anywhere, this little hairdryer isn't one of them.  If you plug this dryer into 250V (European) power without manually changing the voltage selector switch to the 250V setting, the dryer will quickly fail exactly as described.  And that will be your fault, misuse, and not cause for a poor review.<br /><br />Mine has worked fine.  It drys my hair almost as fast as my &#34;professional&#34; dryer at home.  Its size, weight, and performance make this an easy choice for travel.
