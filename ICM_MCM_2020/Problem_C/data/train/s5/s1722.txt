My daughter is in love with her pacifier and these are the only ones she'll take. We found them while on holiday to the US and bought what we thought was a good stock of them but now we're down to only 2!<br /> My problem with my order is that the size wasn't specified when I ordered and I was sent 0-6month pacifiers when I actually wanted the bigger type so she won't take these ones. So for me, it was a  waste of money sadly (lots of money because it was an international order and the shipping was expensive)<br />Not the fault of the seller, I must add.
