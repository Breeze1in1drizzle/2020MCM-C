Let's face it, I'm a guy.  I use a hair dryer about 3 minutes every morning when I get out of the shower.  I don't need tourmaline gemstone coated heating elements, I don't need salon-duty roller bearings, I don't need a pink gemstone-encrusted handle.<br /><br />I need something that blows hot air out the front when you press the switch, and this model does it.  Works fine, without all the bells, whistles, and gee-gaws, and without breaking the bank.  Oh and it's blue.  A good guy color.
