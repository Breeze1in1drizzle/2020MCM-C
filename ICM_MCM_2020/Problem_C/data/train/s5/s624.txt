Good speed and heat options. I like that the hair dryer is pretty small. My other one was huge and awkward to maneuver. The concentrator attachment is good. Every hair dryer needs one. The diffuser is scary haha! I have no idea what to do with it but whatever. It is apparently for creating volume, but I have thick, short asian hair so I don't need any extra volume. Cord length is fine. The back opens up really easily for cleaning. The cool button and cool heat function are ACTUALLY cool. Most hairdryers take time to cool down, so going from hot to cold doesn't work. However, on this hairdryer, if you want to go straight from hot to cool, it happens in seconds. maybe it's just because it has cooled down here in san diego but I can't really definitively determine that. Anyways great hairdryer! :)
