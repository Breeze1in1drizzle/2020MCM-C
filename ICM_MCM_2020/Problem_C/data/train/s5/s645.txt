I was so tired of having my hair dryer stored in a drawer, with a cord that tangled up in everything.....then I found this little wonder and I'm a happy camper.  It is a little larger than those you find in hotel rooms, but it looks nice, has a nice feel in your hand and most importantly, dries your hair perfectly.  It has two speeds which are great for styling, and a cord that is NEVER in your way.  I really love this hair dryer.
