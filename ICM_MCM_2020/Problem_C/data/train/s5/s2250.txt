I don't really know what it is but my little one will only take these pacifiers. I tried pretty much every brand of pacis out there and the only ones she'll take are the ones shaped like the soothies. I love the fact that they are soft so if she rolls over them they won't hurt her.  At first I was worried cuz I thought the round shape covering her nose would be a problem, but now I see it doesn't block her nose at all and she seems very comfortable sucking on them.  I think these are just great.
