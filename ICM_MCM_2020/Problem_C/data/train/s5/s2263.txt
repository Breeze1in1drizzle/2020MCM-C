I tried about 30 pacifiers (yes, really) on my newborn and this nipple type shape was the only shape she liked but the problem I was having with so many pacifiers was that the rim was too big and they would wedge up against her little nose. This one gave her nose enough clearance so that she could comfortably use it. It was also nice that it had a little tab on the back with a hole in it so that I could attach a clip cord to it to keep it from falling on the ground.
