I ordered this microwave to replace an over the over microwave we had that stopped working. We wanted something small since we realized we don't use on much anymore except for frozen vegetables and reheating coffee. We needed a small microwave that would fit in a small area. This was the only corner model microwave I could find anywhere online. It is very cute and looks like an old-school television set. The controls are very simple, there is no number pad, you use the + and - minus signs to adjust cook time. This microwave also has a built in timer  which was also very nice. At only 750 watts, it seems to cook at the same rate as out old 1100 watt microwave.<br />Although the price was  higher that a comprable-sized microwave, the size and shape make it worth the extra money.
