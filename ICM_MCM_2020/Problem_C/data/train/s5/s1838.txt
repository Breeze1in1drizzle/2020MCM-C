On a recommendation of a friend, we ordered these for our daughter and began using them at 2 days old.  Not only are they similar to the Soothies provided by our hospital, these are also recommended for nursing babies, because they don't cause nipple confusion.  Our daughter has shown no signs of confusion, and takes quite well to her GumDrops.  In fact, I just ordered several more sets, as we've lost quite a few already.  Well worth the price for our family...I just wish I could order them by the dozen!
