I have been using this product for nearly a month now. From a guy perspective I think this product is really great. I use this product since my hair is quite long and for some personal reason I don't like to dry my hair using my towel. Anyway, the best thing about this hair dryer is that it dries my hair really fast and also produce low noise. Well, if you use the high air mode, the noise is quite loud but much tolerable than other products I have used. Basically I just used the low air mode since the noise is low and it isn't too hot.     Furthermore, when you first use this product, it will have a burning metal smell (like soldering smell). However, after 3-4 times of use the smell will be gone. The smell won't stick on your hair though, so it isn't a big deal. This hair dryer is light which I think is a plus.
