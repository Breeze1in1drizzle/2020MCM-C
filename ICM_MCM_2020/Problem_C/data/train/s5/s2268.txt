So far, I've tried to give soothie, nuk, and gumdrop pacifiers to my daughter.  My daughter loves the gumdrop pacifier and I like that it does not cover or rub against her nose like the soothie or leave marks on her cheeks like the nuk.  We received the gumdrop pacifier at the hospital and I just ordered 4 more!  Update: Still a huge fan of these and we continued buying through the various stages. When we were given other pacifiers as gifts, we would try them, but never switched brands. My daughter has always preferred the GumDrop pacifiers and still does today. Now it's time to start weaning off of the pacifier!
