At first, I have no idea what kind of diaper bag to choose. Flexible? Rigid? Small? Or Big? I went through pages and reviews and got more confused. Some of them look fashion but I really worried about whether they are practical for me. After all, it is just a diaper bag.<br />I asked my friends whose baby girl is already 3 years old. She told me that you got to buy a diaper bag that is big enough especially when you have twin. That is the most important. Soon you will find it extremely helpful because there is never too many baby stuff to carry. She really have the point.<br />This bag is big and light enough for me. There are some points that I like about it.<br />-It doesn’t have too complex compartments inside which I like. It is easy for me to put things in and take out.<br />-The fabric inside is plastic which is easy to clean in case of bottle leakage. The material is good quality. It doesn’t have that kind of smell which is really not healthy for holding baby stuff.<br />-It has two side pocket and a large pocket for diaper. That is thoughtful because they are the thing you need handy such as diaper or bottle of milk. You need it immediately most of the time.<br />-It surprises me that it also has a transparent plastic bag. I use it to hold dirty or wet clothes. Very thoughtful.<br /><br />List of things I bring for a day out in case you need to know:<br />-A double stroller for my two children which our diaper bag can be easily attached.<br />-change of clothes<br />-diaper for two child.<br />-medicine like vitamins.<br />-paper handkerchief<br />-talc<br />-First aid kit<br />-pacifiers<br />-milk and two bottles.<br />-my wallet<br />-book. I love to read in the park.
