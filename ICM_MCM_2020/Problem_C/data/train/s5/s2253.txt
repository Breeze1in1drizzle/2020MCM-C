I was introduced to this model/brand in the hospital where I came home with 2. Every baby is different and mine took this one immediately after the 2nd day she was born (thank goodness). It is extremely durable and easy to clean. I with either place mine in the microwavable sterilizer I used with bottle parts or wash with hot, soapy water & rinse.<br /><br />My baby has rejected a couple other brands (by flat out spitting them out or I take it as &#34;rejection&#34; when they don't &#34;pacify&#34; her and she keeps fussing). This one always works so when I find something that works baby-product-wise I stick with it!<br /><br />Why I ordered more here on Amazon - quite simply - the small size makes them easy to lose and I have a laborador that I have to be quick about grabbing them if I drop them since she has likened them to one of her toys (sheesh!). So there is no fault of this product - I just care to stockpile these. I keep them in the nursery, in my nightstand drawer, in my diaper bag and in the car.<br /><br />They have 2 good-sized holes where I can easily string a paci-clip through, too. I will for sure re-buy and highly recommend to expectant mothers trying read reviews to determine what to get in advance. This would make my top 5 list of must-haves.
