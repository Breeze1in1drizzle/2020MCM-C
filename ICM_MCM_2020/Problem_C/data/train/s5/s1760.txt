This pacifier is so cute and could make anyone laugh.  I bought it as a shower present for my niece, and there's nothing like getting pictures emailed to you with a sweet baby using this bink.  It's a great little gag gift to include in a present for a new mom, especially if you tease the new mom about Twilight.
