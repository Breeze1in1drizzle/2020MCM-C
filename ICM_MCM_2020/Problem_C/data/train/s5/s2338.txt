This pacifier pouch does the job very well. It easily snaps onto my diaper bag handle and I never had any problem with it getting detached or anything. I like that it has a simple, velcro flap closure instead of zipper closure on a round case as many other pacifier pouches have, so it's very easy to get the pacifier out. I usually have my baby in one arm when I want to take it out, so velcro makes it easier for a quick, one-handed opening. I usually keep one NUK pacifier with a Booginhead Paci Grip attached to it, and it's a perfect fit. I have taken 2 pacifiers and it was kind of tight, but if you don't have the strap, 2 pacifiers would fit pretty well too. The outside fabric is wipable so it's easy to clean if anything gets spilled on it or something.
