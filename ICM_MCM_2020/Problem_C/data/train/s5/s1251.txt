This is the best hairdryer I have ever owned!! It is worth every penny.. I went to my local Sally's and bought two they were 35.00 each.. I had to buy a new one due to my daughter dropped it and Sally's does not have these so I found it on Amazon thank goodness.. If you drop this dryer it will break easily and there is no repairing it. Your hair looks great when you use this one... I will never plan to buy another dryer except this one.. I can't say enough love this one so I highly recommend this dryer..
