I have thick, not coarse, but not silky hair.  I rarely blow dry my hair since it takes so long (maybe 7-10 minutes) with my old hair dryer, and I thought it made my hair coarser.  I decided to give the ion thing a try though, and it was the best investment (in time) ever.  It only takes  two or three minutes on high speed, medium heat to dry an entire head of shoulder-length hair!  (I don't blow until it's bone dry, just dry to the touch.)  After the first time, my hair was super soft.  After the second time, it got even softer and I thought it had more body too.  I've only had it a week, so we'll see how it holds up, but the ions really do work.  I'll probably never air dry again!
