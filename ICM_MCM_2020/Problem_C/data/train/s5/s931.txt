I admit, I was skeptical about whether or not this dryer would really make a difference in how my hair felt but it did!  I have noticed that if I use a<br />Higher speed than is recommended for my hair type, it doesn't make as much of a change but if I follow the proper instructions, my hair is soft<br />And shiny and the results are incredible!
