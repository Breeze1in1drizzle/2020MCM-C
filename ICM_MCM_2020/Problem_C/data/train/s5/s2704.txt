i got these because i was worried that letting my older infant use the 0-3 month size would be some sort of safety hazard. the only real difference is that the plastic on this size is thicker (and thus maybe sturdier). he seems to like them as much as he liked the softer 0-3 month size. but there is enough difference between the sizes that a baby who is more particular about the softness of his soothie might prefer one or the other.
