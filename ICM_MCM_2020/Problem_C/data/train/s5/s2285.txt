This pacifier isn't an orthodontic pacifier, but that is the biggest POSITIVE in my opinion. A newborn doesn't *need* an orthodontic pacifier, a newborn needs what is going to be the most comforting, and the Soothie is the most nipple-like pacifier there is.  If you are a breastfeeding mother, and you decide to use a pacifier, please be sure to use the Soothie. The Soothie will definitely help you avoid any nipple confusion that might occur from using an orthodontic or other odd shaped pacifier.  I love the Soothie, and my son used one until we gave up pacifiers all together. I plan to use a Soothie with my daughter (expected in a couple months), and I know I will not be disappointed.
