my wife had this itme before for more than 10 years and she sed that she love the way it works for all this time that she used this item. she ask me to buy this one because the other one it burns the extension cord actually the plug of the extension and this one have a reset and a power control on the plug so it might be better than the other one and it doesnt get to hot like the old ones
