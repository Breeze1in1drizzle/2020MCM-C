These pacis are great, my daughter was originally hooked on the Avent classic ones but I hated that they had different parts to them that trapped water. I much preferred the all in one design of the soothies or gumdrop pacis, much easier to clean as they are all one piece but my daughter HATED their nipple. These are like the combined best of each, the nipple is a classic style but you get the all in one silicone design of the gumdrop!! They are also so cute. You won't regret these:)
