In a good, no, a great way! It is a *little* heavier than some models, but I'm only using it for a max of 15 minutes a day so that doesn't bother me. And I only mention it here because many of the reviewers I read listed that as a con. As for how quiet it is, I would say it's as quiet as the other &#34;quiet&#34; dryers I've owned made by other companies. It's not a whisper, but it's not a scream. My hair looks better than it has in a long time... It's certainly shinier and looks thicker when I use this dryer. The dryer is also a very sexy looking piece, so if you're going buy based on looks, go for this machine! The only negative I have is the cold shot button. I foresee this button breaking easily and in the near future. I try to avoid using the shot button in favor of the cold setting switch to prolong the inevitable, though.  I truly do love this dryer. I was not compensated for my review. I bought the dryer after researching. I'm very happy with my purchase!
