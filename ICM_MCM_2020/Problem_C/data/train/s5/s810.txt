This was installed in a RV on the wall of the bathroom area. The unit is plugged into a 110 volt GFCI outlet and the night light and unit power can be turned on/off by pressing the GFCI button. The night light is good - not too bright but ample. The unit appears to offer good air flow and not being too noisy. I am happy with the performance, looks and operation so far.
