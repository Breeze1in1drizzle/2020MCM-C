I'm a hairdresser, so I can sometimes go through blowdryers easily. However, this one has lasted over a year! I've bought TwinTurbo dryers before, but this model is compact enough that I can transport it from work to home easily, but the quality is not sacrificed. I love the black matte plastic, too. It makes any scratches or dings practically invisible.
