I don't blow dry my hair everyday, so it hasn't gotten a good solid workout like ones I've used in the past.  That being said, I do like this hairdryer.  It is easy to travel with and doesn't weigh a ton - can easily hold it with one hand without your wrist tiring, while the other hand is styling with a brush.  The retractable cord is still working although at times it takes several tries to get it to completely retract now.  Worked very well when I first received it. Only started having trouble with that part over the past several months.  The control is a single control where the heat setting and volume of air setting are the same (low air flow and cooler air, highest air flow with highest heat.) If you want separate air flow and heat settings, this isn't the dryer for you.
