This cow is much softer than my other Wubbanub that's a lamb.  It is like a velour fabric.  My only complaint is that the cow I received did not have black feet like I expected from the photo.  Maybe it's just a coincidence that the cow in this picture has its spots right on each of its feet.  Wubbanubs are awesome!  I never have pacis dropped on the floor and my little girl loves to hold onto it.  I have also washed it in a mesh lingerie bag and it washed up great!  Just have to let it air dry which didn't take long at all.  I actually gave it to my daughter still damp straight from the wash and she didn't have a problem with it!  Great product.
