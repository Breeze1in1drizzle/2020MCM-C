looks great. it's 15&#34; x 11&#34;. works great. easy to use. it needs distilled/boiled water, but i just do a kettle and fill up a wine bottle and use that a week or two. i wash the items and place it on the rack and when it fills up i turn it on. it has a few options. it has the i need it now 10-15 min., the 45 min. w/dry and the 60 min. like new w/dry. i use it for tons of stuff. from baby toys, to feeding supplies, to straws, jar lids, pump supplies, anything i can put in here that my kid puts in her mouth that is plastic or glass. but in reality it's just a lazy tool. i don't have time to boil stuff on the regular, and i don't use microwaves. it's a rich mans accessory, but it's real nice. if you can justify it, i suggest it.
