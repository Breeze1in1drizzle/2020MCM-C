Ok Here goes. I will explain why this hair dryer is amazing not the circumstances. My two daughters with hair down to their but dry their hair in my wife & I's master bedroom bath. They get up in the morning about 1.5 hours before we do, to go to school. For years the last hour of our sleep was inturupted and we might as well have gotten up with them. This dryer makes 70% less noise & drys their hair in way way less than half the time. The air velocity & heat is not matched by anything out there. Trust me I have bought them all, looking for some peace & quiet in the morning. The velocity alone is triple that of any I have ever seen and the fact that at this air output you can still melt plastic (within 1 inch). They drop this thing every day, yes I hear it even over the use noise and it take a beating. I love this hair dryer even though I used it only 1 time (it dried my short/medium length hair in less than 1.5 minutes. With the other dryers, twenty plus minutes each to dry my girls hair now twenty minutes maybe total. I love this dryer and I only used it once.
