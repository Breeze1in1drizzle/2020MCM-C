Taking into account that this is a travel hair dryer, I have no complaints. It's been used for 5 to 10 minutes every other day for the past couple months and so far not a problem at all. There is only one tiny design complaint I have, and that is I figured the retractable cord would be completely hidden when fully retracted but theres a stopper which allows a good 10 inches of chord to remain...I wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug, but fine. I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars. Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price. For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you'll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway). And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine. Once again, not perfect, but for size it's as good as it gets.<br />UPDATE: It's now been a good 12 months or so, and the usage has gone up to 5-10 minutes almost every day. It's fallen off the counter 3 to 4 times, and still works like a charm. The other day (now about 6 months ago) however, the button to retract the cord flew off (with spring) while the cord was furiously being pulled out. I tried to reattach but it lost its retracting mechanism. Fine, now it's a regular drier. Although I do have to admit it's definitely very powerful for its size, quite amazing actually. Still works like a charm.
