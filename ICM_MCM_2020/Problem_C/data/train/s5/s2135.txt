We LOVE our giraffe Wubbanub!  I bought one before our baby was born to try it out, since I thought it was expensive for a pacifier.  But it's worth every penny.  It's great for keeping the pacifier close, babies love to snuggle the soft toy, and you don't lose pacifiers when your baby spits them out.  I ended up buying two more Wubbanubs because I liked this one so much!
