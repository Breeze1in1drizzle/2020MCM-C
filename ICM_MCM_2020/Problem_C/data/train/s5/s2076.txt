Cute and practical! I'm able to fit two GumDrop pacifiers in this pouch and slip it into my diaper bag or purse, it's very handy.  I love that it's anti-microbial and reusable, my snack-sized Ziploc bag pacifier storage days are over, and I have even more peace of mind about cleanliness. I haven't had a problem with the pocket detaching or falling off of my bag, I use a Skip Hop diaper bag with two interior key hooks, and I attach the pacifier pocket to one of those. So there is never a problem with detachment or locating the pocket, from personal experience.  I can also maneuver the zipper with one hand, which is always nice when you have an infant in your arms.
