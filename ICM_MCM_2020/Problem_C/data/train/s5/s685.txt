I love this product. This is truly an excellent thing to have for anyone who blow dries their hair.  I hate holding my arms above my head for prolonged periods and found this by searching for a product to hold my hair dryer. My one complaint is that the lever that snaps closed when you attach the suction cup...it snapped in half on the second time of use. It seems the shape of the lever makes it weak in the middle - poor design on that part of it. I am still able to attach it however by using a washcloth to hold the jagged edge when clamping the lever down. Other than that, the product is nice looking and functionally excellent.
