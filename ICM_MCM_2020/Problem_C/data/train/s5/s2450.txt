Saw this on SharkTank, bought it for my sister who is expecting. I was impressed with the quality, it far exceeded my expectations!  The movement of the cords up and down is so smooth it doesn't even make a sound. I love that it fits all types of pacifiers so you're not stuck buying only their pacifiers. I wish I had another baby just so I could buy one for myself!!
