Our lactation consultant recommended these over the Soothies, as they maintain better habits. I'm not 100% sure what she means by that, but the kid loves these and took to them almost immediately. They are all one piece which makes for easy cleaning, and you can see through them and be amused by the sucker fish face the kid makes when using them. Selling these in multi-packs is a great idea.
