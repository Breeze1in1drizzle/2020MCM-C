I already have the D3190A, which is a LOT like this AC215C that I selected for my daughter because she likes this color better than the purple.<br />They both have the &#34;cool shot feature&#34; which we love, and the cleanable filter (*VERY important feature to keep airflow going strong) which is key to its ability to dry hair quickly, you would think all hair dryers would have it!<br /><br />Now to its features: it has the three heat settings & two power settings (*I wish it had 3 power settings!)<br />It has a concentrator and a diffuser which my daughter who has a head full of natural curls says it is an ESSENTIAL attachment to have if you have curls like her.<br />It also has the &#34;ionic (heat protection) technology&#34; that keeps your hair free from frizz & fly aways, it dries hair fast we both have long hair & it doesn't tangle it all up when blow drying on high,<br /><br />* ALL of this is just like the purple D3190A model, where it differs is that this one has a<br />FOUR year warranty as opposed to the D3190A, which only has a 2 yr warranty and they say it has a Salon quality AC motor for 4 times a longer life<br />so, that explains the longer warranty. For $10.00 more you get a better value as this is supposed to last twice as long as the purple D3190A one that is $20.00<br />They both function excellently, if money is tight get the purple D3190A one, if you have the extra $10 I would go with this one!
