I have to be completely honest in saying that, I don't understand why this hairdryer is solely being marketed towards men. It's a nice hairdryer and does the same job like hundreds of other hairdryers on the market. Outside of the sporty color that may seem more masculine or the fact that it's inscribed with MANGROOMER on the side of it doesn't change the functionality of the dryer itself. I would have to say that this is psychological advertising at its best! I am a woman and my favorite color in the whole wide world is red which attracted me to this hairdryer plus I needed a new one so I was very happy to get this one! My husband thinks the dryer is ugly. He has never used a hairdryer on his hair because he wears his hair close to the scalp or completely bald. I will admit that this is one of the best hairdryers that I have ever used. It is more powerful than the hairdryer that I just recently tossed into the trash. It drys my hair quickly unlike my other hairdryer.  It is also very sturdy.  I have accidentally dropped the hairdryer on several occasions and there is still not one dent, ding or scratch on the Mangroomer at all. It is definitely built like a man LOL!
