The Nuby Garden Fresh Nibbler is my 6 month old daughter's new favorite &#34;toy&#34;. I am going to buy a couple more because then I can have a few different fruits & veggies for her to eat on hand daily. We have tried strawberries (her favorite), steamed carrots, peas, bananas. She will almost demand it when she sees it. I love everything about it & would recommend them to anyone with a small child who's just starting to try foods. Also to give as part of a baby shower gift. People usually only think tiny baby. They don't think of things like this usually. I personally would have loved to have gotten one for my baby shower & I will definitely be giving these as gifts from now on!
