So, my grandson was complaining how nobody took him seriously, blah blah blah. I'm all like, &#34;Kid, yer 4 months old! Chill!&#34; And he's like, &#34;If I only had facial hair, people would listen to me!&#34;<br />So I got him this here thing.<br />Well, he was right. The Henryville Library now has a Jaxson Section. He spoke last night at the annual meeting of the Henryville Historical Society, and is considering running for mayor in 2016.<br />I highly recommend a mustache pacifier for every young boy.
