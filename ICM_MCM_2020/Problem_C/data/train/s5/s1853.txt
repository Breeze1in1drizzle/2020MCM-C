Can't live without these. All of my kids were born &#34;tongue-tied&#34; and conventional stubby plugs never worked, they refused to use them. These are the only pacifiers my 3 kids would take. I think the length of the nipple is easier for a baby who has difficulty latching, where the conventional plugs are too short. A true in-the-store-at-midnight-cuz-you-lost-the-last-one kind of saving buy!
