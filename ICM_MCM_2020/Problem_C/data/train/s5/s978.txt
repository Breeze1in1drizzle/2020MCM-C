I purchased this hair dryer as a Christmas present and she loves it. The dryer warms instantly, looks great (the matte black....although the pink accent isn't my color), does a great job, and even has little rubber spots on the side, so that it doesn't slip (nice touch). It also has a removable filter that can be cleaned. For the price, I can't complain. I would definitely recommend this to others, as it does a great job at a reasonable price.
