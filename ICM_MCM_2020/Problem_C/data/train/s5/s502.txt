My husband (firefighter) had a nasty habit of leaving the blowdryer on the bathroom counter until it cooled off.  Everytime I walked into the bathroom, there'd be the clean counter with the blowdryer sitting on it so I'd wind up the cord and put it in the cabinet. EVERYDAY.  So for Christmas, I got hubby this blowdryer and we all love it.  Colors are not too white, more ivory and light taupe, but very neutral.  The kids can all use it easily (5 yrs and up), simple on/off button on the base, hi/lo on the dryer handle and it gets put away -- right away.  It took five minutes to hang, we plugged it right into the outlet and I love it!
