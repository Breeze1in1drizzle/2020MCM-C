I absolutely love this blow dryer and the attatchments, I usually buy CHI for my blow dryer but the last one shorted out within a year so I decided on trying Hot Tools and I was in love. Multiple settings so you can dry/style your hair just right and the attachments work great for stying my bangs and straighening with the blow dryer. I would definitely buy Hot Tools and recommend this blow dryer to anyone.
