Love this dryer, compared it with the SEdu 4000 and ended up returning the Sedu because it was much heavier and louder.  THis dryer is quiet, light, and I don't have to straighten my hair after. My hair is thick, wavy and frizzy. It also cut down my drying time about 5 minutes.  So glad I found it on Amazon after a very extensive search. And it was half the price of the Sedu!
