I used this hair dryer while traveling this summer. It was used in the US, Canada and Italy. I was very happy with it. It folds up so it is compact and easy to pack but it is still very powerful for such a little hair dryer. I also appreciate the two attachments that come with it. And, the fact that you can switch it between 120V and 220V makes it incredibly convenient.
