I have very thick, frizzy, and what you could call &#34;confused&#34; hair (not wavy or curly or straight). I have straightened my hair with a blow dryer since I was 13 years old. Needless to say, I have been through A LOT of blow dryers. This is the best one I have ever had. I'm on my second and about to buy my third (for backup). It does get pretty hot, but I alternate with the low and high setting depending on which part of my hair I'm doing and how much is in the piece. I HIGHLY recommend this blow dryer if you have thick, unruly hair as myself, it's a BEAST. What used to take me hours now takes me 30-40 minutes tops. Very happy.
