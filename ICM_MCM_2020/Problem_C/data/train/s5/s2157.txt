I was hesitant to buy this at first because we only use the Gumdrop Pacifiers and I didn't see how I could attach those to the bear. It took some effort but I WAS able to do it (see the pictures I uploaded in the product images).<br /><br />The directions I got with the bear state that it can be tossed in the washing machine - pacifier and all - but I have not done that. It's a personal preference, just not sure how safe it is to get laundry detergent on a pacifier, even if it's rinsed. So I wash the pacifier by hand with hot water and replace it when necessary.<br /><br />When I first bought this my baby (then 8 months) did not like this bear because it was a bit heavy and it kept pulling the pacifier out of her mouth. Within a few days, though, she really got used to it. Before buying this, I was going nuts in the dark trying to locate the pacifier in her crib, and the fact that she has designs on her crib sheets didn't help matters because it was easier to lose among them! I purchased this bear to solve my problem, and it solved my baby's problem, too - when she starts crying at night she locates the bear (easy enough to do, even half asleep), puts the pacifier in her mouth and falls back asleep in no time. This bear is a lifesaver!<br /><br />EDIT: Dec/2013 - I recently had to replace this for my almost 2-year-old as she broke the loop. The original one I bought came in a drawstring bag with the green pacifier pictured as well as a clear plastic flat pacifier that looked like a teether. Now I spent more money (originally bought for around $11, this time bought for $15) and the pacifier pictured and the teether pacifier no longer comes with it. They really cheaped out and raised the price. I'm disappointed. Still a great product but not as pictured! I'd give this 4-stars now.
