I bought this for my 5 yea old daughter because she always wants to do things for herself and I wanted to encourage her independence. This is so small and light. She is able to handle it easily and even though I still have to watch her and help with the use of a hairbrush, she is well on her way to independence. It is very powerful for its size and comes with a nice bag and accessories.
