I bought 3 Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hairdryer back in 2000 and had used them since. After a few years' use I noticed the plastic part got a small hole burnt. I found a way to still use it by letting it sit until it cooled down before placing it back into the mounting fixture. So based on the durability of the product I bought this model again expecting Bunbeam to have improved in the design about the heat discipation. My previous 3 dryer are still working but I changed them all anyway.<br />I'm impressed with the new design - it becomes more stylish and after drying my hair when I hold the blow hole by hand it's just mildly warm - not hot at all. It is not a very quiet hairdryer but I'm happy with the purchase. I expect to last 20 years.
