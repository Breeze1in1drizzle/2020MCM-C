I purchased this drawer microwave from Amazon for a new custom designed kitchen we were installing in our home.  My wife couldn't understand why I wanted it because she had never seen one before and didn't think the whole &#34;drawer thing&#34; was a good idea.  She eventually (reluctantly) agreed because she didn't want a microwave to go over the stove and there were no other good options for our kitchen design.  Once it was installed, she said she liked the looks of it (built into the island).  Everyone else that has seen it really likes the way it looks also because it's kind of unique.  When my wife used it the first time I don't think she wanted to admit I actually had a good idea but the drawer microwave works perfectly and it's easy to get cookware in and out since it's waist high with the door open.  My adult son used the &#34;sensor reheat&#34; button on a restaurant leftover meal he was warming up to eat.  The feature evidently &#34;senses&#34; the air inside the microwave as the meal is cooking and stops automatically when it's ready.  Pretty cool feature!  I love the microwave.  It adds to the custom kitchen design look and it works great.  (I think my wife even smiled one time when she used it)
