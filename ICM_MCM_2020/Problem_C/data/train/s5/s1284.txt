I cannot believe how great this hairdryer really is. I searched and searched for months unsure of who to believe. I have fine hair, not the thick curly that drives most shoppers toward a certain brand. This one works great for my fine hair, and a plus is that I have not had static during the drying process like with the cheaper hairdryers. There are two settings for ionic, and I don't know what the other setting is supposed to do, but the other setting does introduce static, so I use one ionic setting at all times. The main characteristic I searched for was the sound volume and pitch. Someone wrote a review that said they could actually hear the doorbell ring while using this hairdryer, and that convinced me to purchase this model. It is actually true - the pitch is not really a pitch, but rather a low sound that will save my eardrums. My husband can actually sleep when I blow dry, where he could not before. As for lasting ability, it is a quality hairdryer, and I have been using this for about 6 months and it looks as though it will hold up for the long haul.
