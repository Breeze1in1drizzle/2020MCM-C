I have had a hair dryer for years when it gave out. I have always used Con Air products and have been very happy with them. This hair dryer does NOT disappoint.  Great product has several sets to choose from and a cool button which is really neat feature I never had that before. It has high power but not overwhelming for you or your hair. Love this product and love Conair!
