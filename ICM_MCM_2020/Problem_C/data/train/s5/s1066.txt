This is a really good hairdryer.  It is solidly constructed, has three (not two) temperatures.  The little door on the back for clearing the filter is hinged rather than detachable.  It is nicely balanced in the hand.  It comes with the usual attachments, which I don't use so can't judge.<br /><br />It dried my short hair in about 15 seconds.  It dried my visiting sister's long curly hair in about half the time she says it usually takes her.  This is partly attributable to the 1875 watt motor, but I've had another 1875-watt dryer that was less powerful.<br /><br />The virtues come with two possible vices - this thing is heavy, and it doesn't have a retractable cord.  Only the first is a problem for me, as retractable cords add yet more weight and the storage area for them unbalances the dryer in use.<br /><br />Of course it is on the expensive side.  You can get a cheapo hairdryer for $15 or a good one for $30 - $35.  You'll have to decide whether the quality and the features are worth the extra cost.  This one will last longer than your $15 jobbie, and it really does a better faster job.  It's also fashionably pretty if you like the current vogue for shiny chromy things.<br /><br />Mske your own judgement on cost/benefit, but I can testify that you won't be wasting your money.
