Great newborn pacifier that worked well for our son when he was one month old (he was three weeks early). Up to that point we had used the Gum Drop or Soothies, which calmed him, but I had to sit in the back seat of the car and hold them in his mouth. These pacifiers were the answer to that! The size was perfect and he could keep them in his mouth easily. I was also happily surprised that the pattern was much cuter than the picture and the color was a neutral tan. We have since bought them in other sizes and will continue to use these as long as our son has a pacifier.
