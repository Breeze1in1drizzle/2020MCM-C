I wasn't going to let my baby have pacifiers, maybe because where I'm from they're called &#34;dummies&#34;. Anyway, all that changed 3 days after she was born and was screaming non-stop. My mother-in-law sat me down and said &#34;now I know you don't want to use pacifiers but babies need to suck and if you don't want to breastfeed non-stop they'll help... plus they use them in the neo-natal unit at Stanford Hospital so how bad can they be?&#34;<br /><br />At my wit's end and in tears I begged her to get some for me. She returned with 3 kinds (not these, because they're not for newborns). My daughter liked the soft Nuk ones the best, but when she turned 6 months old they were too small for her so I took myself off to the store to find the same, but larger. They don't exist, so flexing my super scientific muscle I endeavored to pick the one that was closest. These were them. The colored bit is hard plastic to keep the shape, but that piece is completely covered in soft silicone. It took my daughter about a day to get used to them and the work wonders for calming her.<br /><br />You set so many rules for yourself as a parent, always with the best of intentions, but you have to be ready to flex and this is one I'm glad we broke. Nap times and I-hate-my-carseat-and-just-want-to-scream times are much easier with these.  We're about to wean her off them, but am so glad we found them when our other ones got too small.
