LOVE this hairdryer!! I keep getting compliments on my hair lately and the only thing I've done differently is to start using this blow dryer (with no cut or professional styling in months)! The small diffuser was a tight fit at first, but the more I've used it, the easier it's gotten. I guess the little tabs had to be rubbed down a bit. Never had a problem with the curling diffuser. 2 months in and am satisfied so far!
