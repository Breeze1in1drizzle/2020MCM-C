First, I am a woman and I got this hairdryer for my own use (my hubby is bald).  The Mangroomer 1680XL-6 did a good job drying my long, thick hair, although not any faster than my old dryer.  Things I like about it:  adjustable heat settings and the attachable diffuser.  It is bigger and slightly heavier than my old drier, but has a good rubber grip, quiet motor, and a fun bright color scheme. I tried it with the ionic setting on and with it off and found no difference in the look of my hair with either.
