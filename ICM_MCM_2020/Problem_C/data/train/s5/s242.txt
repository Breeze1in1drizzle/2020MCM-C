I had a hair dryer with a retractable cord back in the mid 80s and I've been looking for a replacement to love as much as I loved that one ever since it died after 7 years of service. This is an excellent hair dryer that gives a good flow of air. I don't like a dryer that gets too hot, and I was pleased that even the high setting doesn't get so hot that I feel like it's trying to bake my hair rather than dry it. The low setting is great for setting my wavy hair during the final moments of drying. It has a good weight that is substantial without being cumbersome and a good-sized grip. My hair is prone to static and this unit doesn't induce that unpleasant state. I had high expectations for the Andis RC-2 Ionic1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord and it didn't disappoint me.
