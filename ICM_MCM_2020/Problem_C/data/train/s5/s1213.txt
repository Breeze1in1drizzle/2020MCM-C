We now have two of this identical model. The first one worked out well so we bought another for a second bathroom. I can't speak to whether it makes my hair any shinier, but it does a good job of drying my hair and that's all I ask for. It does have different settings -- high, low, warm, cool; my husband uses the lowest settings to blow-dry the dog. I have noticed that the exterior doesn't get as hot as my old dryer so I don't have to be careful where I set it when I'm done. I have no idea what to do with the finger/curly thingy attachment -- maybe I need curly hair to appreciate its use.
