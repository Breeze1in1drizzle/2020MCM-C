I breastfed my daughter for the first two weeks but unfortunately my supply was never established and she dropped almost a pound of her birth weight so we needed to supplement with formula.  She is now exclusively on formula.  When we needed to supplement, I had a horrible time trying to find a bottle that she would take.  I started with the Lanisoh bottles and the Medela bottles because they are supposed to be the best for breastfed babies.  She would not take either of them.  Then I tried First Years Breastflow bottles and Avent.  Again, she would not take either of them.  You can imagine how absolutely stressful this was with a baby who was not thriving.  Eventually we found Dr. Browns and she did take them relatively well, but she always spilled so much formula while eating because the nipples are small and she couldn't &#34;latch&#34; onto the bottle properly.  This made for a big mess and also for a lot of gas because she was sucking a lot of air while trying to eat.  These bottles have BY FAR been the best I have tried with her.  She rarely spills a drop and she is not really gassy on these bottles at all.  Plus, the inclusion of the pacifiers is a wonderful bonus as this is the ONLY paci she will take other than the weird looking Soothies.  She latches to these pacifiers the best, and yes, I have tried MANY MANY brands just as I did with bottles.  These bottles are easy to clean and having the ability to sanitize them in the microwave is a HUGE bonus!!  I find that they don't leak as long as they are assembled correctly.  I also enjoy having the ability to make a 5oz bottle - many bottles only go to 4oz in the smaller size.  Overall, I think these are the best bottles on the market and I highly recommend them.  They have pretty much literally been a lifesaver for us.
