So cute, especially for Christmas. Beyond looking cute, Wubbanubs really do help keep the pacifier in the baby's mouth. And they stop pacifiers from rolling through the slats of the crib and onto the floor during naps or nighttime. Instead, babies can find the paci because the wubbanub falls right next to them and stays put if it comes out when they sleep. So, if they wake up they can just reach for the wubbanub and pop the pacifier back in their mouth once they are a bit older. If the baby is a newborn it also saves you from searching under the crib for lost pacifiers and you can put the pacifier  right back in the baby's mouth if it is too little to do it on their own.<br /><br />This reindeer wubbanub is really cute and festive. It is soft and has plaid on the bottom of the feet and inner ears. It is great for holiday time or all year.
