My old ionic dryer was dying- I liked that this one featured an &#34;on demand&#34; ion option, and other reviewers vouched for its quiet. I am using it now for a few months, and it is really a great dryer.  It is light, balanced, and easy to handle.  I like that you can switch the ion on/off, and that heat/air settings are completely adjustable.  And it really, really is quiet. It does what is says it does, and it is worth the $$.  Also shipped quickly. Makes you hair shiny and fires very quickly.
