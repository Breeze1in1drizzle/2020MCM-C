so glad I purchased this one, so many options out there, but I didn't want to spend a lot, so I choose this based off the reviews, so glad I did. it works great, is super fast compared to all other driers ive had, which is many, and I love the ion, I wont buy one without it, and can tell a difference with ion! if you hold in the blue button it will give you cold air, which is great, you don't have to change the switch to cool air, just hole in the blue button on any setting! GREAT! it gets hot, but not so hot that it burns your neck (or my daughters neck, which is always a problem with the girls, she used to hate the hair dryer cus it was so hot it burned her neck ect), however it is hot enough to dry hair very quickly, which is a great deal for her, since that was her other problem with them. and its great for me too, since a lot of time I barely have time to even halfway dry my hair, now I can fully dry it in that amount of time! it is easy to hold/handle, and has all the options that an expensive dryer would, with the add ons (2 different ones!), they clip on and off easy also! it is sturdy, I have had it for a couple months, and I am very rough with them, leave them in the bathroom, laying out, or tucked beside the makeup table, laying in floor, or just through under the cabnit,, and I have had no issues at all, it doesn't have a scratch on it! amazing! i would recommend this to everybody, my sis already got the same one, after using mine,since she loved it, and still does after a month, and now my mom has the same one as well, and we all bought them on here, to be sure it was the exact same one, since in the stores it gets kinda confussing since so many are similar but not the exact same! so, yes, recommended, love it, love it , love it!
