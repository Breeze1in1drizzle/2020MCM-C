Not only does this dry my hair faster than my older dryer, and it's light, it actually creates lasting body for my fine straight hair that I've never had, and leaves it shiny and looking like a million bucks. Best $130 I've spent in a long time, and cheaper than more frequent hair cuts, that's for sure.
