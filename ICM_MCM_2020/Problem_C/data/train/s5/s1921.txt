We have several of Avent's 'regular' pacifiers at home, which my daughter likes and uses on a regular basis.  When I purchased these, the glow-in-the-dark feature was not important to me, as I really didn't expect the glow to last for long (c'mon folks, it's glow-in-the-dark - the technology hasn't improved much since 1985...haha).  As other reviewers have noted, the glow really does not last too long after the lights go out.<br /><br />I'm sure most parents who use pacifiers for their babies would agree with me on this - we have pacifiers floating all over the house, but it seems whenever you want one, none can be found.  For this reason, I did like the nighttime pattern on the pacifiers; it helps my husband and I to remember that those are the 'bedtime binkies' and when we find them around the house, to put them back into her bed, so we *always* have a pacifier for bedtime.  Yes, the base of the pacifier is larger than Avent's 'regular' design, but I find that the larger base prevents the pacifiers from falling through the slats on my daughter's crib, which happens to the 'regular' design frequently.  Perfect if she wakes in the night; she can find her binkie and replace it herself - which she does.  I'm really pleased with these, as I have been with all Avent products I have purchased.
