Despite the fact that it doesn't have any air temperature settings (air temp and strength are all combined I think, as low, medium and high), I greatly prefer this hair dryer over my old traditional style one. The comb attachments are AWESOME, and I feel like my hair dries much quicker and straighter now that I use them. The way the dryer vertically spreads the air throughout your hair leads to quicker and more even blow drying times and styles as well.<br /><br />I haven't used the brush attachement with the blowdryer but actually sometimes use it to just brush my hair when it's wet haha- works like a charm!
