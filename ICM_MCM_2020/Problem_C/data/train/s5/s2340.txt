The hospital where my grandson was born used these vanilla scene newborn pacifiers.  I know from prior readings that vanilla is a favorite scent of men.  So when he needed more I didn't hesitate to order this specific pacifier.  He liked it, it soothed him.  I guess there's something about the vanilla that works.
