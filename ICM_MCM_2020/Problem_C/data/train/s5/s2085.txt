I introduced this to my son at three weeks. He wouldn't take a larger pacifier, but this is small enough to fit well in his mouth, and light enough that it won't fall out unless he pushes it out. Water does get in it when you clean it, but it takes half a second to squeeze it out. We got one as a shower gift, I've ordered two more, and I'm thinking of getting more.
