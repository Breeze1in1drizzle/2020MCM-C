It was exactly what I thought it would be. It is tremendously quiet and dries on a &#34;medium&#34; setting, the highest temperature option is too hot. When you sit to dry your hair, an office chair won't do. You must use a simple chair not too elaborate not to interfere with the foot of the stand. I am happy with it.
