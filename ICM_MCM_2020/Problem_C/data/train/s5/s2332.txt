These pacis work great for a newborn.  The nipple is larger at the end which makes it easier for the little ones to keep in their mouths.  We tried the Soothie kind and without the bulge at the end, it is harder for our baby to keep it in his mouth.  We also tried the NUK brand, but those have a right side up whereas these can be put in baby's mouth either way.
