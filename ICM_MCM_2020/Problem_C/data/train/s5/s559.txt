I just love my Conair 1875 Blow Dryer.  It's more powerful than any blow dryer that I've ever purchased.  I have long hair that generally takes 15 minutes to dry with my Revlon 1875.  The Conair is three times more powerful and dries my hair in less than 5 minutes.  And it's great for travel because it folds in half and is very, very light in weight.  I happily give this dryer 5 stars and would give it 10 if the option was available.
