My son, who is breastfed, was comfort nursing on me every half an hour so at 3 weeks we introduced a pacifier. We bought dr browns, soothies, wubbies, and these. These are the only ones he really likes. We can sometimes get him to take a soothie after a very long struggle. Will be purchasing more of these.
