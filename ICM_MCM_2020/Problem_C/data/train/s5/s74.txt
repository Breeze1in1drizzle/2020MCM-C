I bought this to replace the exact same one I had purchased 15 years ago. The old one just stopped working on the high setting, but still works on low. Very handy, nice design with the night light feature, keeps the hair dryer out of the way. I was happy to find the exact same item - I got a good 15 years worth of use out of the old one, so I can't complain.
