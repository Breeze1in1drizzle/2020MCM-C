our baby went on a nursing strike for a couple days. this *might* have been what got her back on the breast; it's hard to say since we tried a lot of things at the same time.<br /><br />the first couple feeds with this our baby definitely did not like it - but then she had already stopped feeding from the breast too. we would offer it to her, she would refuse. offer again, refuse. then after a couple tries, she did feed from it. a couple times the first day we had to start with our regular nipple (dr browns) and transfer to this when she was a bit more calm; then she would take it. if she was really really hunger this was not the way to get started.<br /><br />as others reported, she did seem to occasionally choke, maybe on a heavy flow, maybe air, the first couple times. the flow didn't seem slower than other nipples - maybe even faster when she was really hunger, but she just had to work for it. we just had to take the nipple away for a sec and then she'd continue when offered it again.<br /><br />this also made it easier for her to stop feeding when full - she had a habit of feeding until she spit up before, and not tolerating a bottle being taken away, but with this nipple she will stop when full.<br /><br />by the second day she was taking this regularly and by the third day she was back to breastfeeding. not entirely sure this is what did it since we also tried a few others things, but it seemed to help.<br /><br />there are a lot of bad reviews, so i guess it doesn't work for everyone. maybe people didn't stick with it (which i understand if it causes your baby to choke), but it was great for us with a little perseverance.
