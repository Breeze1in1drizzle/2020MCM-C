I have very thick, very curly hair that typically takes a LONG time to dry. The little mini-hair-driers that you find in most hotels these days just won't do the job for me and none of them have a diffuser or will fit a travel-diffuser attachment (which us curly-girls require). But with this hair-drier, I found the answer!!! It has GREAT air-power, 2 heat settings, and dual voltage so you can take it on overseas trips as well. Barely adds any weight to your luggage (so important these days now that airlines charge a hefty fee for non-carry-on luggage or baggage that exceeds their weight limit) and the handle folds up for compact packing. The diffuser attachment works quite well -- maybe not quite as effective as my full-size diffuser with my full-size drier, but pretty darned good. It's great for travel and will have your tresses looking gorgeous in no time. Highly recommended!
