This blow dryer is great. I had a Remington I bought about 6 years ago and it finally died a couple weeks ago. I wanted a replacement that was low energy but just as good at drying. This thing is even better than the last Remington I had. Blows faster, dries quicker, uses less electricity, and is WAY lighter and smaller. Very impressed.
