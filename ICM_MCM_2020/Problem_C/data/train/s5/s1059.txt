I first used this hair dryer at a friend's cabin and I was hooked. The motor is quiet, the dryer itself is pretty light, the blow is intense, and the best part? It gets super hot. You can barely hold your hand under it for too long. I immediately went home and bought it online. I have a medium bob and the dry time was cut in half. My hair seemed fuller and shinier. My roommate was so jealous that she ran out and bought one as well. We both are big into hair tools and are now the biggest fan of this hair dryer. I came upon it in Costco for such a good deal, that I bought another one!<br /><br />The only downside to this dryer, is that it does not come with the defuser attachment. Please, Conair, gimme a defuser!<br /><br />I would recommend this dryer to anyone with hair.
