I love this blow dryer for a couple of reasons:<br /><br />1.  It has a super long cord which is awesome<br />2.  It had not only high and low but you can adjust the heat level as well.<br /><br />There are some things I don't like as well:<br /><br />1.  It is a little heavy but nothing that would sway me from buying again<br />2.  The buttons are in a bad spot and I occasionally bump them.<br /><br />I would definately recommend.
