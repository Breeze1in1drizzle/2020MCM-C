This is a funny story....years ago my husband found one of these cube microwaves at a garage sale for $25.00!  It was perfect for our daughter as she has an extremely SMALL kitchen with very little counter space etc.  Recently I moved to a older home, new home to me with lots of charm and very little counter space. No room for an over the range microwave. My new little Whirlpool Cube fits perfectly into the corner space of my new little kitchen!  Love it, Love it, Love it....however $25.00 would have been an easier price on the pocket book! LOL
