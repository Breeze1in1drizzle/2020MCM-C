I am pleasantly surprised by my effortless shopping experience.  I was a bit leery after reading a few reviews where customers had a hard time contacting the seller or getting satisfaction after receiving defective items but I took a leap of faith since the complaints were few and ordered my dryer.  It came four days early!  Although it came in two separate boxes, installation was a snap even with the minimal directions that were included.  There is a slight burning smell when the dryer is first turned on, but like most new electrical appliances, it soon fades away.  This dryer gets very hot which I love.  I had to lower the thermostat after a few minutes.  The actual hood is larger than I expected and I did worry that it would be top heavy but so far I haven't had any problems.  My sister, who has locs, was impressed.  This dryer completely dried her hair in about 30 minutes and she usually has to sit for more than an hour to ensure that her hair is thoroughly dry.
