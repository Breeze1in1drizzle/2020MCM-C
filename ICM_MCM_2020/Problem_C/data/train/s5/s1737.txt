I bought this for our baby grandson. It is really soft and plush feeling. The sound it makes sounds exactly like an ultrasound of mom's tummy. It has a velcro strap that you can put on the crib, to lull the baby to sleep. Once the baby is older, you can remove the part that makes the noise and use it as bear to sleep with. It looked safe enough to me to let a small child play with. I checked the eyes on the bear and they felt very secure. I thought it was a great value because I wanted my grandson to have a teddy bear and also something that would help him go to sleep.I am a bear collector, so I am picky about the bears I like to buy. This looked more like the old fashioned looking teddy bears because I don't like the bears that have noses the size of a pig's snout. It comes really secured in its packaging and was in perfect shape on arrival. I thought it was an excellent choice for the price.
