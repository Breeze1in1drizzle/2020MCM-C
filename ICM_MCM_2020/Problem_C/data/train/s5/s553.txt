This blow dyer is the best and a deal at this price! I used it and it was SO quiet I couldnt believe it. It also took no time to dry my hair even on the medium setting. I have thick ethnic hair and it left it very manageable and soft. I recommend this dryer. Its not a looker but it gets the job done. Whoever said it was heavy is mistaken, its not heavy at all. The comb attachment is great also.
