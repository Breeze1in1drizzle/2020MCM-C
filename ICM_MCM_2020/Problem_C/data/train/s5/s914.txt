My 12 yr old daughter has long, very thick hair and her arms get tired when she blow dries it. This allows her to read, enjoy a snack and blow dry her hair all at once.  It isn't as fast as a hand held dryer but if she's reading, the longer the better. It has air holes all over the inside and works great for her thick hair.  The ends of her hair that stick out of the bottom take a little longer but it's worth it.  I'm thinking of trying it out... It was a little difficult trying to find a place to set it and a chair that was just the right height. She just keeps it set up all the time and it's become a permanent fixture in her room. Definitely worth it.
