This is a great dryer for me because I would have to consciously TRY to overdry my hair. I have a cheap ConAir that I keep on hand for when my good dryers break so I can get by until a good one arrives. This is a good one, and what a difference! I'm so glad it arrived quickly or my hair would've been toast! I have thick, fine, fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment I have had no problems. The only problem was on my end. When the unit arrived, I thought the spongy tape material within the concentrators were for packing purposes so removed it. I had to get some more from a local craft store so DO NOT REMOVE THAT TAPE!! My bad.<br /><br />Again, I'm not a professional but I don't want charbroiled hair either. I'm pretty confident that won't happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use. I'm fond of haircare products with argan oil in them for its thermal protection since my stylist tells me my ends aren't bad at all; that's after she reprimands me for not coming in but every 6 to 9 months.<br /><br />I ordered the [[ASIN:B002RC8IMQ Andis Elevate Nano-diamond Ceramic Digital Flat Iron]] to go with it and was not so happy, so see that review to understand why.<br /><br />I even used the Elevate on my dog today without issue. Of course it helps that I used to groom dogs so know better than to leave it in one spot for too long which can endanger a pet by burning him/her.<br /><br />Addendum 03/15/2012<br />I've noticed a few people complain about the design of the dryer with regard to the on/off switch and utilizing the pik attachment. It takes some getting used to in order to hold the dryer and feed your hair through the pik. I had a difficult time at first as well. I can't describe the way I do it (I'm not even sure I'm doing it correctly). I can only say that once I got used to it, it was easy to use the pik and NOT shut the dryer off.
