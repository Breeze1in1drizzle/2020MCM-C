Got this for my granddaughter and was worried it might not be as good as the other Wubbanubs because of the extra piece of material attaching the caterpillar to the pacifier.  She still needs help sometimes getting these pacifiers in her mouth, but the flexibility of this Wubbanub with the extra material actually makes it easier for her to get and keep this pacifier in her mouth.  Usually one would think caterpillars would be more of a boy preference, but the colors of the caterpillar and the caterpillar itself deserves the name Cutsie because that's exactly what it is.  Even though Wubbanubs are expensive, they are a wonderful aid allowing babies to find and get their pacifiers into their mouths.  I have been happy with my Wubbanub purchases.
