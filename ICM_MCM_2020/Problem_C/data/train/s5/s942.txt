Very nice hair dryer. I first got to try this in a hotel in New York. I was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair. I knew I had to get one when I got home! It dries your hair nicely without cooking your head! My old dryer got so hot it was uncomfortable. Not this one. I'm very happy with my purchase. Great price too!
