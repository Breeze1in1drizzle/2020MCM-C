these are the only pacifiers my daughter likes at the moment.  I like the different colors they sell too.  Im not into pink much, so my daughter doesnt wear a lot of pink, mostly neutrals or purple.  She gets called a boy often but with these pacifiers now she doesnt.  haha.  my only problem with these is that because they dont have an open handle like most pacifiers do, you have to be careful what paicfier clip to buy, because some are thick and meant to be used on the hard plastic pacis.  but luckily they make paci holders that have a small string to just draw thru.
