The only pacifier that our baby would consistently take. Great to be able to get several at a low price so we could keep one everywhere we needed it - diaper bag, daycare, nursery, car seat (our car seat has a little tag that is at the perfect location to have the pacifier reach the baby when used with an Ulubulu pacifier clip), etc.
