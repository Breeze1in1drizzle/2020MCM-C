I bought this for my niece when she was born.  She loves it!  She had to be under the light while in the hospital.  My sister couldn't hold her and the baby wanted physical touch.  She would cry if someone wasn't touching her.  When we gave her this she quieted immediately.  She loved the way it felt on her tummy.  Now she is 8 months old and still this is her go-to binki!  And it's so cute!
