Cute little m/w. Have been working good so far. No issues. Good enough for a couple to warm up/heat things in small quantity. Takes a little more time (quite natural as its just 700 watts) but reasonable enough. Overall, a nice buy.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to operate. Many quick options, Cute little and looks sturdy, a big space saver if you have small kitchen space.<br />Cons: None so far.<br /><br />Overall, a no non-sense simple m/w for day to day use. Serves the purpose.....
