This is a basic hair dryer. The feature differentiates it from other competitors is the twist folding handle. The power is 1875 watt. It is quite decent, but most of the hair dryers have that same power. It may be because the same AC motor is sued. It has two heat settings with a button to blow air only. The ceramic technology is also in other hair dryers.  All in all, this is a basic solid hair dryer. If you are not crazy about the folding handle, you can go for the competitors at a slightly lower price.
