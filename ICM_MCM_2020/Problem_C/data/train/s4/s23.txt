I bought this hair dryer just to travel with. I used it in Ireland and it worked great. All you need is an adapter. Don't use a converter! The hair dryer will zap out the converter. My sister and I were both pleased with the strength of this little hair dryer (we both have really thick hair). It's light and compact, so it travels well. I haven't used it in the States yet, but I assume it will be just as good.
