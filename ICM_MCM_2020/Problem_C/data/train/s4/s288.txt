I ordered this because of the price and the reviews. It's a decent hair dryer but the bristle attachment (the only one I had planned to use) was flimsy. Flimsy in a way that the bristles bend from pressure easily so if you have a lot of hair, it wont go all the way through. I would suggest this item for people with, at most, normal thickness hair. I would not suggest this item for women of darker skin. I myself am Caucasian but I have medium thickness, curly hair and I can just barely use it. I have to use the comb attachments and thats not very fun. I suggest this item mostly for women with a little but of curl that they want to straighten out.
