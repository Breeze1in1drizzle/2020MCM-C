Its got great quality material. Few things I don't like about it is the color of the lips is not natural-looking, but it would've not affected my decision of buying it if i've seen one in person before buying it. This pacifier made people laugh inspite of it. When washing it, water seeps inside the nipple and baby could drink that stagnant (dirty) water.
