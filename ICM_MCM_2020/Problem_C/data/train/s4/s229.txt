Does what it's supposed to; haven't had any problems with it yet, but the sliding switches seem really cheap. Better quality switches would have pushed it to 5 stars; shame they cut corners on the only moving piece that you actually have to manipulate to use the thing; reminding me how cheap it feels when I use it every time.
