This microwave works well on a counter top.  My previous Microwave had a analog timer so I'm obviously not too picky about microwaves.  It should get the job done on most foods.  The quality is a bit iffy though because the first one I received from Amazon was half &#34;caved in,&#34; literally!  It's really lightweight and simple in design.  A good inexpensive option for regular everyday heating.
