I like it more than the one I have.  I wish it had 6 settings through low/med/high and cool/warm/hot; that would make it better. Then I would love it. To be fair, I knew it didn't have all of those settings when I bought it. I have not gone to Europe with it yet, I'll see if the electricity conversion truly works then.
