Pros: It is dual voltage (120 volts 60 hertz or 240 volts 50 hertz) allowing you to use it in the US and abroad. There is a screw for you to change the voltage. It's almost as powerful and heats up like a regular dryer, which is a huge plus for me.  I've got a ton of hair and those wimpy hotel Sunbeam wall mount dryers just don't cut it.<br /><br />Cons: It's expensive. I would not invest in this as your every day dryer as you can get a better full-size dryer for the price but if you travel a lot, as I do, the voltage option is key. It's a lot heavier and bulkier than the typical travel hair dryer so I would not recommend this if you're looking for something small. There is a hinge at the handle that allows it to fold but it's still far from compact.<br /><br />I've been taking this dryer with me to Europe and it works great. I've been using it intermittently for a year and it's still going strong. Essentially, it's a full-size dryer but with a voltage option.  However, I don't use this in lieu of my full size dryer because I love my light weight FHI Nano.
