I feel that this product was misrepresented since it was listed in the travel dryers.  It is the size of any large dryer and I needed a dryer for traveling that was compact to fit into a small case. It had all the requirements I wanted except way too large.  I have two large ones already.<br />IT WAS NOT COMPACT  That was my only complaint.  I sent it back of course.
