I love the MAM pacifiers but really wish these glowed for longer. Also unless you place them in direct sunlight or near a light for an extended period of time they don't glow very brightly. Otherwise I love these. Love that when my daughter looses her paci in the middle of the night and starts to fuss I can find it.
