The hair dryer delivered all that it promises. The one problem I had was that it shut down for 5-10mins when it overheated...I have long, thick hair so I was patient but it was a bit frustrating. It shut off 3 times during the hair drying process.<br />Anyone with short/med length fine hair should have no issues. Remember to change the voltage on dryer to whatever the requirements are in the country you're visiting.
