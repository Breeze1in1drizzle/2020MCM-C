However, it is a little heavier than my other hair dryers.  But it dries hair very quickly the different heat settings work nicely.  Dryer is comfortable to hold and is powerful/hot enough that I can hold it 6-8 inches from my head and it will still dry my hair effectively.  My only problem with the hair dryer is that it is somewhat too powerful to use the diffuser if I want to dry my naturally curly hair into curls.  Even on the low power setting, it blows my hair to hard and the curls go all over the place and don't form nicely.  If I want to have curly hair for the day, I use one of my other, less powerful dryers.  Works great for my straight hair days, though!
