I guess I wasn't reading the description quite right when I ordered this dryer, I was hoping it had 2 levels of power plus 3 temps. But at low temp the dryer blows less air, and at high temp it blasts my hair making it hard to style. So I just use the medium setting - medium heat/medium air flow. I do really like the folding feature and retractable cord. They make it so much easier to store in a bathroom vanity drawer. It is not lightweight so don't buy it if you are looking for a lightweight travel dryer. It's more of a space-saver in the bathroom rather than the suitcase! I do like the Andis brand, not sure if I would buy this particular one again because of the temp/air flow issue, but it is definitely well made and worth the money.
