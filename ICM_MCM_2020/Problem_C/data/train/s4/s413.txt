Just got this delivered today, fast service. Put it together, but the directions and picture show a power on/off switch, mine doesn't have one, and instead of Fahrenheit it is Celsius. The dryer goes on when you set the timer. The picture on the box also shows a on/off button. Other than turning it on, I haven't used it. Tomorrow I will try it out.
