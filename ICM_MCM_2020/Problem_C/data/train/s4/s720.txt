I was hoping my newborn would like these. They are a little too big for a 2 week old but definitely saving to try at a later time. I sanitized the best I could without getting them too hot (boiling is not a good idea from what I read from previous buyers). She didn't seem to like the taste but then again she is 2 weeks old and only likes food in her mouth:). Try are exactly what I ordered so I gave 4 stars. Just a little too big for newborns... It covers her nose:/
