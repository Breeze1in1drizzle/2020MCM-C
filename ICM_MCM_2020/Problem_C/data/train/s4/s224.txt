I have long, wavy and very thin hair. It usually take me 15 min to dry it and with this Farouk is just 5 min w minimum frizz!  I used many cheap (under $40) hair dryer one, which all were a big disappointment.   I bought this Orange Farouck 2 months ago and I am very happy w it.  To begin with the price was wonderful ( 250.00 actual price and I bought $45.00 on Amazon). It is also light weight and have soft volume ( hate loud hair dryer ) and it dries my hair in 5 minutes. If this dryer had  shorter cord or had retractable Cord I would give it 5 stars.
