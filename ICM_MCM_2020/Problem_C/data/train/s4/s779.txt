My son has always loved mam pacifiers. We started with the 0-6month ones then got the 6month+ air and the ones with the teethers on the side. He loves all of those. We are now using the mam perfect to try to wean off the pacifier. He gets ear infections and we were told to limit the pacifier. Since the mam perfect is thinner I feel comfortable using it. He does prefer the regular ones though but will take this since I don't give him the other option much any more. We are down to pacifiers only for naps and bedtime (and it falls out soon after he's asleep)
