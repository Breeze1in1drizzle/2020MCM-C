This pacifier is super silly-especially when my little one (10 months) hams it up.  My baby usually gets attention (she's a people person), but I love hearing the random giggles as we go by.    Just a note because I couldn't find info on it when I first looked:  The shape of the actual sucking part is more like the playtex pacifier style (with the upturn on the end).  We usually use advent which has a different style.
