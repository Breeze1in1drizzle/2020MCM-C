We started out with these and the Soothie pacifiers. Our daughter started with the Soothie and seemed to have a preference for that initially. She did later take this paci as well, however with both this and the Soothie, she kept spitting it out. I initially wanted to use these so as to eliminate the possibility of nipple confusion - however we soon realized that wasn't a big deal as she was doing great nursing.  We bought some of the Avent infant pacifiers and she loved those. They have a small 'bulb' shape at the end - so as she's sucking, she's keeping it in her mouth.  We had no problems with those being spit out.  I've seen a few babies successfully use and keep these style pacifiers in, but most I've talked to start with these and then soon move on to the Avent pacifiers.  While it is well made and a great style (I like that it's not the big green circle in her face), I probably wouldn't have needed to buy these.
