The Munchkin Healthflow Deluxe Bottle and Food Warmer is easy and convenient. Using the water measure is not an exact science and has been more of a trial and error process. I say error meaning that slightly too little water (lower measurement mark) just means the 2-3 oz of chilled formula warmed in a Ventaire 6 oz bottle is only luke warm...which doesn't seem to phase my infant when she is ready for a meal. Also, if the water measurement is filled over the upper mark, the bottle is still comfortably warm for feeding. My husband and I have not had a bottle that was too cold or too hot which is one less thing to worry and fuss about when we are half asleep fumbling in the kitchen in the middle of the night to feed our newborn.<br /><br />Because of the type of bottles we use, we occasionally have formula leak out from the bottom seal during the warming process. This is easy to clean even if it gets baked a bit from the warming plate by using the bottle scrubber, dish soap, and a paper towel to wipe it up. The leak can be avoided, by the way, if you take the cap off before heating so that the pressure escapes through the top (nipple) rather than the bottom (seal) of the Ventaire bottle.<br /><br />I do not know how the warmer will perform when the baby starts to drink more each feeding. If we continue to use ready-to-feed formula which needs to be chilled I imagine we might have to warm larger bottles twice before they are ready. More likely, we will switch to powdered formula and flouridated water at room temperature which will only need one time through the warmer.<br /><br />In summary: Four stars for a good product only because I anticipate having to be flexible with it's use.
