I used this dryer for four days while staying at a Hyatt hotel. I was immediately impressed by how powerfully and quickly it dried my hair.  The retractable cord was an instant hit with me as well; the cord on my current dryer is presently tangled up all over my bathroom sink.<br /><br />It is a bit heavy and bulky (I wasn't aware that it folded).<br /><br />I wasn't in the market for a dryer, but I liked this one enough after my hotel test-drive that I will be purchasing one immediately!<br /><br />Update Nov 2012: So, I've used this daily for a year. A good dryer, I must admit I don't find anything particularly different about this Ionic dryer as compared to other dryers (e.g., I can't say my hair is shinier or more manageable). Still, a good, but heavy, dryer. I'm still enjoying that retractable cord!
