These wipes are nice for on the go, or when you wont be near a sink to wash off pacifiers.  I keep them in the diaper bag, and they've definitely come in handy.  I also use them to wipe down her play tray and teething toys.  Since they are a little on the expensive side for daily use, I mostly use them for emergency situations, or in the car.  Great for on the go!  Good product.
