Overall, I'm quite happy with this hairdryer. I didn't give it a 5/5 because I'm not quite raving--it didn't transform my hair, like some people claimed, or dramatically reduce my drying time, but for the price, this hairdryer is a great value and I think I'll be using mine for quite some time to come.<br /><br />I've owned this hairdryer for about a month now. Here are my impressions:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Doesn't get as hot, but dries my hair in about the same amount of time as my old (non-ceramic, non-ionic) hairdryer (if anything, a little faster). Lower heat is less damaging to my hair, so since this dryer still gets it done just as quickly, that's a good thing in my book!<br />- Has three heat settings and two intensity settings, allowing for lots of control.<br />- Has a cold shot button that functions well.<br />- Retractable cord is very convenient for traveling and storage.<br />- Design is sleek and attractive.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I wish the cord were just a little longer. Maybe I'm asking for too much, but this one seems a little shorter than my last, and I find myself pulling on it fairly often.<br />- The hairdryer is a bit heavy, but nothing unmanageable. Get that arm workout!<br /><br />I haven't used the diffuser or concentrator attachments, so I can't give an accurate review of those. But just out of the box and unmodified, this dryer has proved to be a good purchase for me.
