If I am to be honest, I have NEVER found a hair dryer that I truly loved.  I have VERY think and VERY long hair, so finding a dryer that lives up to the task is hard to find.  My hair dryer runs for a good 30 minutes straight which means #1. By the time I get through drying my hair I am sweating due to the heat needed to accomplish this task and #2. My arms are really tired by the time I'm done. Which brings me to the 2 things I absolutely LOVED about this hair dryer.<br /><br />*It didn't take 30 minutes to dry my hair. It took about 15 and my face never felt the heat from the dryer. I'm not exactly sure how this happens, but I found myself on several occasions actually reaching my hand up in front of the dryer to make sure it was blowing hot. It was. All I felt was a cool breeze on my face while my hair took the brunt of the heat.<br />*Even though it looks really heavy (I kind of freaked out at it's size when I pulled it out of the box) it's actually quite light and balanced, so it doesn't put a lot of stress on your arm while you are styling your hair.<br /><br />Now... here are the features that I loved.<br /><br />*It has 3 different speeds & temps allowing you to mix and match according to your hair type. (these are toggle switches)<br />*It has a locking cold button so you don't have to struggle while setting your style & holding down a button at the same time<br />*It came with 3 different attachments, 2 directionals and a diffuser<br />*The ion actually made my hair shiny, so much so that I DIDN'T need to use my flat iron when I was done drying my hair.<br /><br />Overall quality product. A little pricey, but well worth the money if you have difficult/think/hard to manage hair.
