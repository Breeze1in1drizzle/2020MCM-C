I ordered this because I wanted a powerful. non-ionic, non-tourmaline, non-ceramic hair dryer... which is almost impossible to find now, as I'm sure you realize if you're looking at this!  I am VERY happy with it!  I only have a couple of small cons... one is that the dryer is fairly heavy, which I only may be noticing because I'm getting old!; the other is that it is slightly difficult to regulate the temperature to the level of warm I want... it's not too bad, but is slightly warmer than I'd like.  If you, like me, are searching for a dryer of all the nons I would recommend this!
