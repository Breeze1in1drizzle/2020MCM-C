I purchased this haridryer for one reason- I broke both of my elbows in a fall and needed to have a lightweight dryer to use after the splints came off.  This hairdryer is by far the lightest I have seen and it has been easy for me to use.  This may be important for people with muscle/nerve/arthritic issues and should be considered for this reason. There are only two speeds and settings so you can not have high heat on a low speed and visa versa.
