When our old Sharp &#34;over the range&#34; started to die (14 years of service and the display had become very dim and door starting to crack with quite large chips falling off we decided it had to be replaced). Finding an over range (gas) with convection and a good extractor fan proved difficult and so we decided on this Sharp product. At 71 lbs and with different mounting points from it's predecessor it was a difficult installation task - could not have been done by one person on their own.<br />Once in place however it is the greatest ! It is better designed than the one before with 2 extractor inlets placed to handle the heat from the gas range very well , a large ceramic turntable that is easy to clean PLUS it can be selected to &#34;not rotate&#34; which permits bigger dishes to be used as needed.<br /><br />Best of all it has a &#34;keep warm&#34; feature that allows warming serving plates as well as keeping unserved food ready  for &#34;seconds&#34; without the whole reheat cycle.<br /><br />Great product - would have given 5 stars but for the physical difficulty of installation ( in fairness that would have probably been much the same for any brand)
