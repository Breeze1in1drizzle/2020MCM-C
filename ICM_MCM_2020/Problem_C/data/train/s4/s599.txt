Had 6 months.  It works fine as a microwave, but the control pad is a little small and you have to be careful where to push to get the button you want. Window is hard to see the food through, and it always fogs up making it even harder. I like the favorites program, but they should build in an automatic delay between stages. This is because if you program 1 min at high, and 1 min at 50%, you actually get about 1:15 straight high. A third stage would also be nice.  I don't like the push button door latch.  It takes a lot of effort, and if it gets dirty, is hard to clean because it pushes in 1/4 inch without any effort, making wiping it hard. It should have s simple handle.
