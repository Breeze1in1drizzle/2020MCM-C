Love the mommy bears! The womb sound is a comfort for for baby and soon the whole house will sleep to the wooshing sound! I bought one for my son 12 years ago and have given one to every new baby in our family since. It has a sleep timer and shuts off by itself after a while. Great for every baby and family!
