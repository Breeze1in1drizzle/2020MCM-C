For my entire half century of life, I've been blessed with curly hair which morphs to piles of frizz in rainy, snowy or humid weather.  Regular hand-held hair dryers never quite dried my very-thick hair and didn't prevent the frizz.  This one not only dries my hair, but does so quickly and a lot more quietly than any other I've used.  The best thing is that it really does reduce the FrizzFactor significantly.  I won't claim it's completely gone, but having 90% less frizz is cause for celebration and a four-star rating.  By the way, I live in HotLanta where frizzy-hair weather lasts longer than a Maine winter.
