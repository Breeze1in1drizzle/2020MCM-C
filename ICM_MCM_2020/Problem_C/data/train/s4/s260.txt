Very powerful on High setting.  Needs a middle setting though.  Rocker switch very hard to move accurately from one setting to another, but maybe that will improve with use.  Shot of cool air feature is helpful and hair dries quickly with smooth finish.  I rarely use my full sized Chi dryer as the size, power and weight make this my go to dryer. That said, I haven't used this for international travel so cannot vouch for other features.  Overall a great value for the price!
