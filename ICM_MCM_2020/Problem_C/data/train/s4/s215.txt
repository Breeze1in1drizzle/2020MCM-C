I like this hair dryer a lot.  It does dry my hair faster and it is quieter compared to my old 30 dollar dryer.  The only con is that it is heavier than my old dryer.  I'm a little concerned about how it was packaged.  It looks like the item was opened and then repackaged.  Each piece inside the box was repackaged and closed with twisty ties.  Hopefully I won't have any problems with it and it will last.  I would recommend this dryer to anyone who has thick hair and a lot of it!
