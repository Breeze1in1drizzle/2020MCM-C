My wife was looking for a small hair dryer that would not to hot. This product was just perfect. It is small but powerful enough to dry hair quickly. It may not be good for someone with alot of hair. It has two speeds, high and low but only one heat temperature. It would be more helpful it had a warm and a hot temperature, but for the price it was well worth it.
