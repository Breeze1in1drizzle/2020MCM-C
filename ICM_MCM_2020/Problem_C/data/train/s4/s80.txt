I bought this hairdryer because the one I had died.  It was basically the exact same dryer in a different color, and it lasted 5 years.  I believe mine died because of a short in the cable, so I am choosing NOT to hang this one by the opening at the end of the base, even though it looks like it should be hung that way.  This drier is the cheapest ceramic ionic drier I have found, and it truly works fast.  I can dry my thick, curly (though short) hair in 5-10 minutes, and it does not get frizzy.  I only use the warm setting-- hot is too hot for me, and I appreciate the cool burst though I wish it had a cool setting. It also is a standard size, so can take a diffuser without a problem-- I use it this way every day.  I couldn't live without this dryer-- it dries my hair so fast without any damage.  Also, I do not find it too heavy.
