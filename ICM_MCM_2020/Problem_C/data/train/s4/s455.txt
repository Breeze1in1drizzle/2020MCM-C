I gave my daughter, a hair stylist, this Panasonic hair dryer to try out.  She liked it so much that she took it to work and replaced her other dryer with this one.  She told me that no matter what hair type she worked on, this hair dryer made the client's hair look fuller, and silky.  Maybe it's the &#34;nanoe technology&#34; that makes the difference.  She also liked the extra long cord (9 ft).  The only negative thing was that it's a little on the heavy side for home use, although professional hair dryers tend to be that way.  Imported from Thailand.
