I have a full sized chi hair dryer, which I like.  I was looking for a similar dryer that I could take with me when I traveled -- hotel dryers were ok, but I missed a better dry...<br /><br />This dryer is fine.  The handle collapses so it is easy enough to stow, and it also comes with its own little cloth bag which is good to keep the cord from getting tangled up during transport.<br /><br />My hair is dried well, though not as well as my full sized dryer at home.  No complaints, however.<br /><br />I would recommend this for size, easy of use, and the nice added accessory of the bag.
