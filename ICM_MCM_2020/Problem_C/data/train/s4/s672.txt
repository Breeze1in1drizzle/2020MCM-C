My little guy had turned his old, barely-used Soothies into teething toys recently and we've caught him shoving the whole darn thing in his mouth. And while I'm not concerned about choking, it was clear he needed something 'more'.<br /><br />As soon as I received this, he happily took to it.<br /><br />He seems to enjoy the extra material for holding onto it while he moves it around his mouth.<br /><br />It isn't the teething golden grail of a toy I was hoping for, but it seems to be a nice addition to his chewing-things collection.
