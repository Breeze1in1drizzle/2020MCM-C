This thing has lots of power --- works so fast, and seems to do so without damaging the hair... I was wavering between this dryer and another that was a bit cheaper. But was glad that I chose this one, as it's the most satisfying hair dryer I've used at home thus far.<br /><br />My only issue with it is that the sliding switches are annoying to use, as they are very stiff. Wish that this awesome product came with easier to maneuver switches.... Maybe next time, in the redesign, it will?
