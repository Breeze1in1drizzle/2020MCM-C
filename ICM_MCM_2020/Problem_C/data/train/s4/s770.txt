if you have a kid who likes pacifiers, then you must know that a good pacifier is a lifesaver. these wubanubs are my child's best friends. i have two on hand, we lost one tragically in the great mall incident of 2014. backtracked through the entire mall in a desperate search to find the lion wubanub we had.<br /><br />for newborns, they provide a small weight so it doesn't pop out of the mouth. as the kid gets older, it's something to hold onto while they suck away to their heart's content.<br /><br />the only problem they have is that they're not very easy to wash, but i'm sure there's some reason for the pacifier not being detachable. And that reason is that if it were detachable, then people would attach it to their own little plush dolls instead of buying more wubanubs.
