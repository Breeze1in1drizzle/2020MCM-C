I had received a RaZbaby Keep-it-Kleen in a Stork Stack. I left it with my family while they watched our baby when we were out of the house for a few hours. Until that visit, we had been using Natursutten pacifiers for the baby. Our family gave it to the baby and it was an instant hit. One of the biggest issues with using pacifiers is if they drop, unless you have something handy to clean the pacifier, you are out of luck. The Keep-It-Kleen pacifiers automatically close as they fall away from your baby's mouth.<br /><br />I ended up purchasing a couple of the RaZbaby pacifiers to keep on hand, including Panky Panda.<br /><br />There are a few cons to the pacifiers, which is why I didn't give it five stars. One is for younger newborns/babies, the closing of the pacifier can anger them if they pop it out a little too far before trying to retrieve it instantly with mouth suction. The second is the design can leave them very slimey with saliva and drool. Regular cleaning or swapping with a replacement helps with this. Lastly, the flaps will likely leave an imprint where it laid around the baby's mouth, but a lot of pacifiers will do that.
