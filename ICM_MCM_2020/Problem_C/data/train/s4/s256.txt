I have had this for more than a few months now, and can say it works wonderfully.  I have not noticed, personally, and huge difference because of the tourmaline ions, but that isn't to say that there isn't any.  I have pretty normal hair, and it has stayed pretty normal.  I will say that this system seems to dry my hair a bit faster and it does not get that brittle feel to it when I actually use it to style my hair as well.  Good product, good price.  Not a miracle worker, but reliability is sometimes more important than miracles :)
