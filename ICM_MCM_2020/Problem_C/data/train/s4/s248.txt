I was honestly not expecting that much from this blowdryer due to its low cost, but I am happy to report that I really underestimated it.  It is lightweight, has a reasonably powerful motor, and a good range of power and temperature selections.  I also like that it features tourmaline ceramic as this really does help to smooth my hair.  The lint filter on the back is also very easy to clean, which is important.  I've burned out several blowdryers due to clogged air intake, but I know it won't happen with this one as the lint is so easy to remove.  The only reason I'm giving this blowdryer four stars instead of five is because it is not QUITE as powerful as others I've used, which adds a little extra time to my blowdrying, maybe a couple of minutes.  It really is a nice blowdryer overall and a terrific value.
