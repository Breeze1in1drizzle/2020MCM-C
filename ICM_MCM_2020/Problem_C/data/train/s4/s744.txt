we bought one when my son was 2 months bc he couldn't keep his bink (he calls it his ning ning) in his mouth by himself.  this was perfect to keep it in.  now he's 21 months and if he wakes up in the middle of the night, he can find it himself in the dark.  he still has that first bink, along with two more.  He goes to bed with all of them.    the only reason i am giving it 4 starts is bc the bink does not detach from the animal, so if it has to be replaced i have to buy more, remove the old one, and sew the new one on.  It's a pain bc i have to do it about twice a month.  i know it's probably time to take the binks away from him, but he loves them so much i can't do it yet.
