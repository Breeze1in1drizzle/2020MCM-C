Avent orthodontic pacifiers are our favorite.  Why you ask?  Because they have COVERS!  No need for plastic bags.  These particular ones (which are the Classic version) are good for the first 3 months.  They are slightly smaller than the 0-6 months Free Flow pacifiers.  They do get cloudy after a while and we toss them after 3-4 weeks.  These have worked for our breast fed baby, but if you are looking for a pacifier which would mimic suckling at the breast, go with the Soothie (ask for a couple free ones at the hospital, even if you don't plan on introducing a binky until 3-4 weeks).  Of note (since I just read this, I thought I'd share), the recommendations say to stop daytime use of binkies at 4 months and nap/night use at 12 months.  These are made in Germany.
