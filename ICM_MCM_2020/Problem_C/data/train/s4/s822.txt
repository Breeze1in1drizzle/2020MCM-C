These are the only pacifiers our daughter will use.  They are ok except that sometimes after washing them in the dishwasher they get cloudy.<br /><br />Also, you need to look for paci clips that have a loop at the end to thread through to hole on the pacifier.  If you get a standard clip it may not work.<br /><br />Finally, we do love these but they bounce like crazy! We are constantly losing them because if they get dropped they bounce so much they can't be found until we clean behind the furniture!
