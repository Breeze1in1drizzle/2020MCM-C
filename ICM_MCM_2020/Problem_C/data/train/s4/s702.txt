Not crazy about the color but after a over a month of use, we really like this product. I'm a huge germ phobe. I carry hand wipes & like to sanitize everything! It fits well in the diaper bag and so it goes everywhere. I have had no problems with mine. We use the energizer rechargeables and it still was working up to a little over a dozen uses. The price is a little steep in my opinion but I'm glad we have it!
