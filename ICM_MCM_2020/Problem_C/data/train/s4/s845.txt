My baby won't take any other pacifier! The round bulb end make its easy to suck. The only problem I have with these is that sometimes when I hand wash them, water gets trapped inside the round dome on the front of the pacifier and then slowly leaks out, which confuses and disturbs my baby. I now just make sure to wash them with the nipple facing down so that water cannot get inside this compartment. Otherwise, we are VERY happy with these pacifiers!<br /><br />I do have to say that the &#34;glow in the dark&#34; features of these is EXTREMELY faint. I certainly would not buy these JUST for that feature, because at night, you definitely CAN NOT see them in the crib.
