Not many reviews about this Danby unit. I replaced another 900 watt Hamilton Beach unit with this one. The main reason was the H-B unit light was off when the door was opened. Aside from that it was a good unit. I gave it away.<br />This Danby does have the interior light on when you open the door. This makes it easier to remove hot beverages without fumbling and spills. It is somewhat louder than the old one. It makes a humming noise when running. All make some noise, but this is almost annoying.<br /><br />At 900 watts you can expect moderate cook times. The table turns slower than others. The old one made one revolution in 10 seconds. This one takes about 13+ seconds. No big deal, but when heating a cup of coffee, the handle might be in the rear of the oven when finished heating. In other words, it was easier to use multiples of 10 (like 60 seconds) and have the handle of a cup right there in front.<br /><br />Aside from that it runs fine. No comment on quality since it too new to judge. At these lower prices they are pretty much throw-aways when they die. Like the other reviewer this unit was purchased at Walmart. I buy lots from Amazon and have alwaye been highly satisfied with service and products. It was simply cheaper at $73 total price with tax.
