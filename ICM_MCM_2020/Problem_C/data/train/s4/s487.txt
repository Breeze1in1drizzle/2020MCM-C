I bought this microwave to replace my previous Sharp R-1449.  This one is deeper, more plastic, and slightly more powerful.  It seems reliable (only have had it 6 weeks), has a good vent and good stove lights.  I wish it had a night light and a switch to stop turntable rotation though one can get around it by removing the turntable. My biggest disappointment was that it utilizes a different mounting plate than my previous Sharp microwave.    I gave it four stars b/c it does the job and it was inexpensive compared to other manufacturers. Incidentally, mounting instructions were very good.
