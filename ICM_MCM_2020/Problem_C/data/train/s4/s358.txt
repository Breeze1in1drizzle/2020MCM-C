The stand might be the only ineffective part. I am still having a hard time screwing in the wheels to the stand as I feel they are not compatible. I cant tell you how the rest works because I am still having issues with the stand.<br /><br />Okay so I finally fixed the wheels (my way) and was able to use it with no difficulty. The product worked very well and heats well. I would recommend if this is a starter dryer for someone.
