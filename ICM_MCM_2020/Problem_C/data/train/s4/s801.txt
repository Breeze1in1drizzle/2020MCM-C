I wanted to switch my baby from the Ecopiggies to Natursutten but she just wouldn't have it. The Ecopiggies are hollow in the middle and have a hole so they are super soft to suck on. These on the other hand have the little hole in the middle plugged up making the pacifier a bit stiffer. It is nice thought that water (and germs) don't get in there like it does inside the Ecopiggies. Babies are all different and I wish I had introduced these pacifiers before the Ecopiggies.
