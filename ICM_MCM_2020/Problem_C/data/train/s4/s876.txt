not as flexible as the wubbanub, but my son was able to hold onto this pacimal pretty easily.  i wish the animal faced him vs me, but that's okay. it's much more weighted than the wubbanub so it stays in place a lot easier if my son is holding it; however if i'm trying to rock him it's harder to keep in place, whereas the wubbanub i can kind of prop against my chest.
