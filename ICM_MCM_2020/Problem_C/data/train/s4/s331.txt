This hair dryer is pretty good for the price. I previously had a conair ceramic hair dryer with a retractable cord. It did a good job, but was heavy, and ultimately it was the retractable cord that caused the dryer to stop working. The Conair 256P is nice and light. I have curly hair and do not dry it completely, so I put the heat on the warm setting and the blower on high and it works great for me. It doesn't come with a diffuser, but I don't use one. It does however come with the vent attachment so you can direct the air flow. My son uses the dryer as well and likes it. The only complaint I would have is that it is noisy. Basically, it's light and does a great job and the price is right.
