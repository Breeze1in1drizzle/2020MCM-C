This General Electric microwave works fine as far as cooking things or heating up water; but my menu display has never worked. I can see the menu on the machine; but what the microwave is actually doing does not show up. It is a low powered microwave; so it takes a while to cook with it. I use it daily for cooking food and heating up water for tea or soup.     Underneath the rotating plate rusted as water from boiling water dripped down onto the inside of the microwave. So the plastic or polymer covering came off the bottom; but it works fine still spins around as it works. The light comes on when I open the door more than a year and a half later since I got it. It does not take up much space.
