Both my kids loved MAM pacifiers as newborns. Unfortunately, my 3 month old didn't like these as much because they are latex, not the silicone that she is used to (I did not read description clearly). The pacifier was softer and slippery and just kept slipping out of her mouth. She fussed until I gave her a silicone one again (then she fell right to sleep).<br /><br />I still love MAM pacifiers. This one just didn't work for us.
