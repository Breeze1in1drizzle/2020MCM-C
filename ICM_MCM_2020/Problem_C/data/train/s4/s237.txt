I needed a dryer with a diffuser attachment to dry my permed hair, so after looking at a bunch of different ones on Amazon I chose this one. I think it's a great dryer for the cost. The diffuser works well and keeps my hair curly without making it too frizzy. It also dried it fairly quickly. I didn't like how long the cold shot button took to work. It would also be nice if it got hotter for the lower setting. Overall, for the price, I think this was a great buy and I'm very happy with it.
