I bought this dryer based on the user reviews and am very pleased. It has a lot of drying power. It's light. It's quiet. It's nicely balanced. It's not necessary to grip the handle to hold the dryer. It will balance in the crook of your left thumb, so your hand and arm won't get tired from holding it. I can't say for certain, since I don't have carpal tunnel syndrome, but this may be a great dryer for people who suffer from it since there's no need to clinch a fist to hold it. Though I was at first disappointed that I can't remove the screens to clean them (and will need to do it with the vacuum cleaner) I later decided that for price and performance, this is a pretty great dryer.
