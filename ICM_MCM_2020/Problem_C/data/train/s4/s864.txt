This diaper bag is eye-popping chipper and very trendy.  The first thing I noticed were snap-on nylon straps so I can attach this to a stroller.  The only thing Iâ€™ll need to keep in mind is not to overload the Ecosusi.  That wouldnâ€™t be very hard to do because there are so many pockets to tuck things in, including two little lined containers that match the bag.  I can use one for a bottle, the other for a pacifier.  Itâ€™s one of those diaper bags that was more than likely one in which they consulted mothers on.  It has all the features I like to see in a bag.<br /><br />There are synthetic zippers, which are easier to work, and metal zipper pulls.  The hardware is a mix of metal and plastic.  The one vulnerability I see in the bag are the plastic adjustable sliders on the strap. The material is waterproof 600d nylon, something I see many lightweight backpacks are made of and perfect for a diaper bag.  The design is new-generation stylish, but with an old-fashioned dollop of fun I like.  Itâ€™s a more modern design line that has enough of a selection to suit everyone.<br /><br />The inside of the bagâ€™s design pops and is totally functional with all kinds of pockets ... zippered elasticized, and simple.  I definitely like the small included changing pad that will certainly come in handy.  Thereâ€™s a metal quick release swivel snap for those house or car keys if youâ€™re walking around.  The Ecosusi has a large enough capacity to hold diapers, a change of clothes, snacks, and other essentials needed for a small excursion.<br /><br />I do have stroller straps I can use to hook this diaper bag on my Graco for quick access.  As I mentioned, in does have those snap on nylon straps if you donâ€™t have one.  It does have 1-1/2â€?nylon straps so I can swing it over my shoulder or, if I prefer, I can carry it by the sturdy rolled up nylon handles.  Diaper bags arenâ€™t carried for long periods of time like backpacks and similar to my other one, the padding is lacking in the straps.  Rather par for the course in the diaper bag line unless youâ€™re willing to buy something rather pricey.<br /><br />Pockets, pockets, pockets, changing pad, extra containers, metal zipper pulls, and on and on.  I do love this bag and I love the chipper design.  Itâ€™s quite roomy and has those little extras that make it quite appealing.  I would have preferred metal hardware, but the plastic is heavy and probably impact-resistant.  Very nice, stylish, ultra-functional diaper bag that will come in handy.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.in the straps.
