I bought this after I had received the lamb one as a gift and loved it. I think the lamb one is actually better but I still like the puppy. This one is just a little more awkward than the lamb and the colors are more yellow, not brown as it appears in the picture. Overall though, I think these WubbaNub pacifiers are great products and a necessity during the early months. I like that I can tuck the stuffed animal into my sons car seat straps to hold it in place. It's also nice that it lays on his chest when not strapped into anything and I don't have to constantly push the pacifier back into his mouth like you do with regular pacifiers. His little hand can also grab onto the stuffed animal easily.
