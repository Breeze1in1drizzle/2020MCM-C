I haven't had a chance to try this yet, but I like that it's all natural, one piece, and made to support breastfeeding (the large flat shield is large on purpose so it touches the baby's nose as in bfing - though this might not work well for all babies). I noticed a lot of reviewers mentioned how you have to replace it so often, which worried me at first, too, b/c of the price. But on the manufacturer's website, they say that while they have to have that recommendation on their packaging due to European standards, you don't actually have to replace it nearly that often. They also mention that it may whiten after sterilizing, but will return to its normal color in a few days, and that it may turn brown over time which is also totally normal b/c it's natural rubber and oxidizes. Just wanted to help clear things up!
