For its price it's a good little microwave. It does slide when I try to open it since it's very lightweight and doesn't have any rubber feet. The inside is smaller than I'm used to, but I knew that when I purchased it. I was looking for small to fit in a smaller space. I don't use it to really cook only reheat so it totally meets my needs. I only gave it 4 stars because it slides across the counter when I open the door. Hopefully, I can add some rubber feet to stop this.
