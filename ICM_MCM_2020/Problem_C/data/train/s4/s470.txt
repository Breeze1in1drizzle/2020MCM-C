The Conair 1875-Watt Cord Keeper is, well, a keeper. After several years with heavy ceramic hair dryers with winding the cord after use, The Conair is a breath of fresh air. The cord itself is very easy to take out and retract. Making it pretty much usable with any plug in our bathroom vanity. When you turn it on, you notice how quiet it is compared to your past hair dryers. Comes in handy when your spouse may be sleeping in while you get ready in the morning. How well does it work? Longer, thicker hair seems to dry much faster and with it's lightweight use, it is much easier to sustain longer positions when drying thicker hair. The three temperature settings are nice and really easy to get to with one hand. With the retractable cord, ease of use and the lightweight features of this, I can highly recommend it.
