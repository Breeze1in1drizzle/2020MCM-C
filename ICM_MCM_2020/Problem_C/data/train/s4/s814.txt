My baby does not take pacifiers, so I have been using this carrying case to transport a teething toy instead.  It keeps the toy clean and accessible when I am out and about with her.  I wish I had one of these pacifier pockets with my first child though since she was obsessed with her pacis and this is plenty big enough to accommodate two just in case one goes missing :)
