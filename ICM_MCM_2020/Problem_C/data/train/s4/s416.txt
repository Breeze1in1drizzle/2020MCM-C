The instructions for assembling this item were not good.  Obviously written in Chinese or Japanese then poorly translated.  However, my husband did eventually get the item assembled and I have used it only once.  However, I am happy with it.  It is quiet and efficient and dried my hair raidly.  At this point I would recommend this product.
