I bought this for my wife, wasn't sure because as seen on TV products are often very gimicky... but she LOVES it. A few women I've told about the gift thought it was great too.  It's bulky and heavy, but that's a good sign that it's built well and will last. The suction cup was large, but it has fallen down once. Because of it's size and weight, attaching it and pulling it off the mirror every time you use it is not an option, but it's a little scary leaving it up all the time. (tip, don't put anything expensive underneath it). (better tip: thoroughly clean mirror and blo-and-go with alcohol before application.     I wish this came with an option to attach securly to wall with screws. The image shows it attached to a wall or a door, but I highly doubt it could do that... needs a completely clean flat surface like glass.    Other than that, I am satisfied.
