This microwave was a replacement for a different brand.  But for $169 (and I found an online coupon to boot) it was worth every cent spent.  Granted, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles my old microwave had, but what do we generally use a microwave for...reheating, defrosting and popcorn...so why spend the extra cash? <br /> <br />Installation was not quite so easy as others indicated as I was replacing a different brand, which meant drilling new holes in cabinet, and installing a new bracket behind the microwave, but still, for the money saved, well worth the effort.  It does not come with a charcoal filter so be prepared to buy one separately if you are going ventless (do it at the time of purchase if you can find it on Amazon so you can save the shipping cost). <br /> <br />The rating I gave is due to the lack of features...basic microwave with few extras, but the price made it 4 stars! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
