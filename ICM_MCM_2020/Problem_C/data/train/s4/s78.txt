Before purchasing this hair dryer I read pretty much all of the reviews on the earlier edition.  The ratings were high, so I decided to get the latest edition and try it out.  I wasn't sure if the dryer would work wonders with my hair type.  As an African American female with natural hair, finding a blow dryer that straightens as well as dries quickly is always a process.  But using the Andis is like a breath of fresh air! It takes me about 10-15 to dry my hair with the comb extension.  And Yay for the comb extension! I am so happy with my purchase I have been telling everyone I know to get it:)
