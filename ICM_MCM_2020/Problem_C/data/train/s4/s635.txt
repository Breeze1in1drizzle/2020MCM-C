Love this sound machine. The volume can be turned up loud enough to fill the room which is great and it has a 40 minute automatic shut off. We had another similar product that had no volume adjustment and only a 20 minute shut off, both were the same price. While the womb sounds don't put our baby to sleep they keep him asleep longer and in a deeper state. Would recommend this sound machine  over others!
