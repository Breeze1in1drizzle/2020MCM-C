I really liked this warmer. I was given one when my first daughter was born. As some of the reviews state, it may take a little practise to get used to how much water to put in, but that doesn't take much to master. The only recommendation that I have is that if you use the Dr. Brown's bottles with the tubes in them, take the tubes out before putting the bottle in the warmer, or you'll end up with the milk leaking into the warmer.
