If you can get your baby to accept this binky, this would be a wonderful choice!  It is natural rubber and I was told that it is latex free.  Being that my husband has many relatives with latex allergies, I don't want to expose my children to latex if I don't have to.<br /><br />I LOVE that this is a one piece design.  I know this sounds paranoid, but I can't help worrying about other pacifiers coming apart.  It's also very easy to clean and doesn't get gunk built up in it.  I also love that it's made from a natural material.  I know that the other pacifiers out there are free of BPA and all, but who's to say that there isn't something else in them that we'll later learn isn't healthy?  It's also nice to know that my baby can't shove these in her mouth.<br /><br />These also look very cute and retro.  The pacifiers I used as a baby back in 1980 look nearly identical.  They may not suit everyone's taste, however.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the largest size (12 month+) has a very large bulb at the end.  I guess the best reference I can think of is that it was quite a bit larger than those round Gerber binkies.  I tried the largest size when my baby was 18 months and she rejected it immediately.  (I've tried offering it to her a few times and she just chews on it a bit and tosses it aside.)  Maybe my children are just on the sensitive side, but I can't imagine that any of them would have accepted it.  It's not a big deal to size down, but since these can get expensive, I wish I had known that before making my purchase.
