This is the first blow dryer I've ever had. It's simple and pretty effective. I gave it 4/5 stars because I was a little confused with how to make it work. Great for the price. It has only two settings, low and high. I've used the low setting only. I wish it had had a better explanation for how to make it start working. Otherwise, it's great, no complaints.
