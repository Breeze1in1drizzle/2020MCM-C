It is well priced.  It does an amazing job at drying hair.  The product performs as advertised. The only negative is the plastic base (legs) are not sturdy (strong, firm) enough to hold the weight of the entire equipment and they will tend to bend a litle.  Pity to build a nice product and have it downgraded because the cheap construction of the base.
