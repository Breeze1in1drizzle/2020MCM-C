The Mangroomer is a large yet lightweight dryer that provides quiet and powerful hair drying action. Even my wife's thick and long hair is dried within minutes. The size of the hair dryer means it is not meant for travel, but rather one that should stay at home. The cord length is appropriate and does not interfere with my morning routine of getting ready and singing along to Katy Perry in the mirror and imagining myself at Madison Square Garden.
