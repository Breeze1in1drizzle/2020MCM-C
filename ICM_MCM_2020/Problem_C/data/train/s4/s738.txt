These really are the best pacifiers for toddlers and much nicer than NUK (at least according to my little brother).  The MAM pacifiers are round on both sides of the nub, while the NUK pacifiers tend to have a flat side to rest on your tongue, however it's really a personal preference, so I'd try both with your little one to see which one they like more.  Like other reviewers though, I'm disappointed that it's impossible to choose colors or at least themes!
