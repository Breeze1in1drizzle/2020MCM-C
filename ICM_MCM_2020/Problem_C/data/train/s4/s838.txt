Works perfectly, product is just as described. Easy to use, especially if you have a baby that likes the pacifier...it can be difficult to use if you cannot get the baby to suck long enough or if their mouth is still too small to use it. If I had to make the choice of an infant thermometer again I would pay a little more for a forehead thermometer which I imagine would be the easiest way to take a temperature.
