Purchased this above the range microwave while searching for a different size by accident. Kept it for my work home, work in a different state than we live. Installed it and it does not work. Been working with the factory to get it working instead of returning it. Still trying after 3 weeks. First they sent me to the wrong repair shop, then the replacement part was bad and now waiting on the 2nd part. I don't know if I would be as understanding if this was at family home.
