I paid $2.30 for each of these nuks. I have the 0-3 mo version and so far my baby likes those better than these but that is as  expected as he will not be 3 months for another week. These seem exactly the same as 0 month ones but they have a slightly thicker round base and ever so slightly thicker nipple.
