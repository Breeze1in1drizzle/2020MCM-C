This was a fine dryer, but I returned it. It simply wasn't as quiet as I hoped. i ended up going to a drugstore in town and plugging in all the dryers. The one I purchased was also ionic, but much quieter owing to the fact that it had three speeds and two heat settings. That means I can keep the middle speed and the cold heat setting, and it's much quieter than other dryers I tried.
