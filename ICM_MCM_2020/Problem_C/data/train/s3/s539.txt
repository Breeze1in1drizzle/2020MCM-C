I bought this because my daughter loves her monkey wubbanub and I wanted to make sure that she had a back up in case her monkey got lost.  I personally this is very cute.  It does look more like a sheep with long ears than a bunny but regardless its cute.  The body is not as long as the other wubbanubs I have seen and it is about 3/4 the size of one.  Although I think it is, my 10 month old daughter does not like this one at all.  I think it's because it's a little harder to hold than the monkey because the body is so short.  Also, the fabric is a little bit fluffier than the monkey so I think that it feels different to her as well.  Although we still have this at home and she uses it occasionally (we still try and give it to her), she definitely prefers her monkey.
