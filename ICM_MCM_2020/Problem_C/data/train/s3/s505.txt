Let me say first, shipping and such was amazing. I ordered these on a Friday night and received them on a Sunday! I don't know if anyone else ever received mail on a Sunday from the USPS but it was a first for me and it was amazing to get it so quickly. Now the product; exactly what I expected to receive. I had read that babies that like the soothie but have trouble holding onto it like this pacifier, so I ordered it along with some of the latex nuk (the silicone are all I have in my area and my son hates them, my older son used latex and I read the latex is softer, so here we are ðŸ˜Š) well I sterilized them and then tried to use it, but the difference between these and the soothie is a slight bulb at the end where the soothie is more straight (maybe this is why it's easier to hold on to?). The bulb at the end seems to be slightly large for my sons mouth, he had trouble trying to get it in his mouth. So those were out. Maybe he'll like them when he's a little older ( my son was 6 weeks when we tried these). I would suggest buying these and the regular latex nuk pacifiers and see which they prefer. As a side note, I breastfeed as well as almost all of my friends and we all use pacifiers without any nope confusion, maybe it can cause it but i have never seen it, so if you're breastfeeding but don't agree with the breastfeeding nazis that you should be a pacifier as well as a bottle give the pacifiers a try because i think the risk must be minimal of nipple confusion.
