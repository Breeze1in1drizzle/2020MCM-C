When I opened the box i was surprised by how nice it was. It has 3 different levels and the directions even recomend whates better for your hair type. Their is no problem with it its just i thought it would give off more heat. My hair is thick and it took longer than expected for it to dry. I am just gonna use it till it breaks i guess.
