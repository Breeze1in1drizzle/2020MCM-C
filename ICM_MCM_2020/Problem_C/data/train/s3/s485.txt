My son loves this pacifier, just as he loves all his natursuttens, however I was a little disappointed by the butterfly. Whereas most butterfly pacifiers fall well below the nasal passages, this one pushes right up against them- at least on my son. I find I am more comfortable giving him the natursutten round pacifier. The butterfly is great in theory but personally, I prefer their round now that we've tried both out.
