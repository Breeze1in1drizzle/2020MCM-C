Was hoping to find a pacifier that my guy would take....he is almost 3 months old and still wants to nurse every 2 hours around-the-clock, and I have a sneakin suspicion that it is not all nutritive nursing!!!  Unfortunately, this was not the one.  Seems big and heavy.  Otherwise, material and construction seem just fine.
