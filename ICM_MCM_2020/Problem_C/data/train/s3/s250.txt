The John Frieda JF1 does all it says it will. Shiny hair with no static. Dries quickly without the high pitched roar of other dryers. The overall look is very nice. Just one major problem...its very heavy. If you are in it for the long haul,as with long thick hair styling,you better be young and strong. I am over sixty and have medium length fine hair and I find it easier to just use the curling Iron on most days. If you are not using the blow dryer for styling it works just fine and comes with several heads for specific drying.
