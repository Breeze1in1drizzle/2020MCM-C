It works OK. Easy to use. Nothing special about it.  It says for salon use but, it would take to long to dry Salon hair. I had a salon use blow dryer and it dried my hair much faster but the price was around $200 to replace it.  so, for the price of the MHD dryer it works just fine. It just takes longer.
