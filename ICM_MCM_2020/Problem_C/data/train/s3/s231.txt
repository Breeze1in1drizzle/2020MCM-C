While this dryer does a nice job of keeping frizz away, it takes forever to dry my thick, shoulder-length hair with it.  Even when I've used the highest settings on it, it takes me twice as long to dry my hair with this Remington than it does with my [[ASIN:B003521CA2 Conair 259 Infiniti Pro AC Motor Styling Tool, Orange]].  I have wavy/curly hair, so I usually use a diffuser, but I've tried this both with the diffuser and without it, and each time it's taken me awhile to dry my hair.<br /><br />Some other pros of this dryer are that it has a nice feel to it (the material that it's made out of has a pearlescent, matte finish), isn't too heavy (so your arm doesn't get too tired while holding it), and comes with some nice attachments.  The diffuser, though, has prongs that are asymmetrical in length, so it takes awhile to get used to using it.<br /><br />Since many of the other reviews are glowing and say that this dryer dries in record time, I'm wondering if I received a defective unit. As I mentioned, it does cut down on frizz, but I prefer my Conair for a faster drying time.
