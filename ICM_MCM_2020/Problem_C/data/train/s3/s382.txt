bought for a buddy  but then i had a baby and got one too. i don't think it is meant for baby to actually suck on. seems to be too big for baby even now at a year old. she sucked on it long enough for a few pictures to laugh at. but that is about it. so if you are looking for a quick laugh, then it's funny. if you think baby is going to suck on this on a regular basis, probably not going to happen
