I travel fairly frequently, so hotels are a routine affair. I saw this hair dryer at a hotel recently. Its performance was impressive for its size. As soon as I got home I ordered one. I found the included mounting kit (screws, 3M tape, dry wall anchors) a little flimsy. I used a better wall anchor to mount the dryer.<br /><br />All was well for 3 days. The hair dryer worked like a champ, until the third day when the on/off switch blew up in my hands. The switch had shorted out, causing a large poof of smoke/fire. This of course happened just after I had tossed the original packaging and Amazon shipping box. So I contacted the manufacture about a replacement. They were VERY interested in getting this dryer to the corporate offices ASAP. They sent out FedEx the next day to pick up the device to be sent back. I just received my replacement device, it took 15 days in total to receive it.<br /><br />I really hope this one lasts a bit longer.<br /><br />EDIT: I added photos to the product page showing how the switch blew up.
