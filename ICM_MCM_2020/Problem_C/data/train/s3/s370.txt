Very basic, works fine, a little noisier than I like (both mechanically and the door) and is a great price for what you are getting. For instance, the microwave I am replacing cost about $800. I wouldn't say the same negatives on that one... but it cost 8X as much. This one is a good deal if you aren't looking for top-of-the-line.
