I have thick hair and need a dryer with powerful motor and high output. While this dryer is quiet and lightweight, it did not have any more power than the $20 dryer I was using before. I could not find any wattage/power specifications on the packaging or in the product manual. I am returning it so I cannot comment on durability or how long it lasts.
