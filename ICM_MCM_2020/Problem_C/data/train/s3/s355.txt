This microwave is great for portability and also defrosts meats well without over doing it.<br />It looks good in the kitchen and is good for basic use as long as your not in a hurry.<br />It has no power compared to a full size one.<br />What takes 30 seconds in my old panasonic takes 1 1/2 minutes in this one. Thats reheating a cup of coffee.<br />We keep the old micro plugged in, in the basement if we need larger things heated quicker and to be HOT.<br />Reheating leftovers takes much longer. Point being if your into getting things heated quickly this is not the microwave for you.<br />It has an annoying beep that continuously goes off about every 30 seconds after something has been heated until you open the door. Like you need to be reminded. Just another electronic noise nobody needs.<br />Its expensive for what you get. You are paying for portability.
