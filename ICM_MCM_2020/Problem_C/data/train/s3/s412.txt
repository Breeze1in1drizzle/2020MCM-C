I bought this for my newborn. As a first time mom, I wanted to make sure that everything that baby touches is germ-free. I've used this wipe on several occassion to quick clean her pacifiers after its been sitting out for several days. When I try to give her the paci after the cleaning, she spits it back out and gives me a disgusting taste face. Apparently baby isn't a fan of the after-taste these wipes leave behind. I'll still keep these to clean her plastic toys, but won't be buying anymore.
