Bought this microwave in 2011 to replace a 30 year old Sharp Carousel that was given to us 20 years ago. The Sharp didn't heat evenly, but it lasted much longer than this one did. This GE microwave looks great and heats fast and evenly for the most part and I love the inverter defroster! But it is impossible to make good popcorn, no matter what settings I use it always ends up with lots of unpopped kernels and some of it burned. I wish the door closure was designed better. As with most modern day products, the plastic parts just don't hold up to everyday use. It currently only works if you slam the door hard. I have a feeling that its days are numbered and I won't be replacing it with another GE microwave!!
