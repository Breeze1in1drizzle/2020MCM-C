This was the first time I spent  more than $40 for a hair dryer, so I was expecting it to be great. But after about a month the attachment nozzle kept following off. However the dryer works well, it is still aggravating for the nozzle to fly off while drying my hair. I should have returned it. Too much money for an okay hair dryer!
