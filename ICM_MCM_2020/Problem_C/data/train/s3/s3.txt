It's an ok drier but there are so many better options out there with a stronger motor. The airflow is weak even on the highest setting. It says its a 1875w drier but it dries the hair more like a 1200w one. Also it is quite bulky. It does reduce frizz and improve the shine.<br /><br />I recommend it to a person with short and fine hair. If you have coarse or curly hair, I wouldn't pick this one.
