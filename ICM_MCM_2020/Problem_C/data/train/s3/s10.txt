The dryer is small but packs enough punch for my wife.  Installed the unit when we remodeled in 1998 and it just died this morning.  I'm buying another - since it will slide right into the space vacated by the old one I won't have any wallpaper issues to contend with and, for $20, its hard to beat the value.
