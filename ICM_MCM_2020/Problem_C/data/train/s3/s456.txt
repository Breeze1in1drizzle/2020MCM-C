Our baby is currently 5 weeks old and I think he's a little young for the Binkibear. He doesn't have good movement yet and ends up either yanking the bear (and the pacifier) out of his mouth, or it causes the pacifier to sit crooked in his mouth. Its a fabulous product that we will have to put away until he's old enough.
