We purchased ours about 6 months ago and we find it to work as about as well as we assumed it would given it's low power and lower price. Expect longer heating times than a larger microwave oven. If you are an impatient person you may want to pass on this model.    The Hot Water presets work fine for reheating coffee.    Our one real complaint is that the turntable is all too easily dislodged from the spindle if a heavy item is not carefully placed near the center of the surface. We find this design defect really annoying and would not choose this model again for this reason alone.
