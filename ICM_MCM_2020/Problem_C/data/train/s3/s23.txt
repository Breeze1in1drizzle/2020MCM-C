The item is described as a soft bonnet hair dryer.  The dryer works, but the bonnet is not at all soft.  It occasionally irritates the neck because of stiffness where the hose joins the bonnet.  The temperatures can get too hot; low heat is hotter than my previous hair dryer ever got on its maximum heat setting. Watch out!
