This is the first time that I've spent over $30 for a hair dryer. I was really looking forward to using this. I have had this hair dryer for 1 month, and I have to say that my biggest complaint is the nozzle attachment keeps falling off which is very aggravating.  Other than that I love how quick it dries my hair, and it does make my hair look more smoother.  I have thick wavy curly frizzy hair.
