My wife and I really do like these Pacifiers. They work well enough (especially for the price) and our SMALL for her age daughter loves them. At 7 months our daughter is still wearing 3 month clothing and can't take a large paci. These are just the right size and are great now that she is mobile.<br /><br />The one negative (for us) with these is that they wear out/break way too quickly. I'm ok with this due to the price, but I'd be sure to buy more than one.
