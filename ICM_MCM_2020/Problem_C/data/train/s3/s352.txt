I bought a Samsung SMH9187W over the oven microwave in 2010 at Sears. ($249.00) Looked nice and worked well.<br /><br />Here is a warning. Don't have a steaming pot under the control panel for an extended time. Moisture ruins the control panel.<br /><br />I cooked homemade soup on the burner below the control panel. The steam from cooking so long, ruined a part in the panel. It never worked again. I got an Se5 code when I tried to turn it on. Looked it up on the internet. Indicated moisture damage to something. Be careful.
