This microwave is fine. It is not great. It takes three and a half minutes to warm up a cup of coffee, but since that is its only function on our counter it is doing its job, just slower than some of the more powerful ones. Its size is definitely a plus and fits in a wee corner. Its not having more programable numbers is annoying as one has to hold the button as the time counts up incrementally, but for a cup warmer it will do.
