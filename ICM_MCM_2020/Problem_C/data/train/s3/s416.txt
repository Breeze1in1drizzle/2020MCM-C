I only bought this pacifier because it was supposed to glow in the dark and I thought it would make it easier to find it when my daughter dropped it in the middle of the night. It does glow a little, but not for long. After a few minutes in the dark the glow disappears and in the middle of the night when you most need it it is long time gone.<br />It also has a different shape than the regular Avent. It is not symmetrical and has an up and down side. So, in addition to be as hard to find as a regular pacifier, I still have to figure out in the dark which side is up and down. Conclusion: not really good for nighttime.<br />In a side note, Avents are good quality pacifiers and this one is not different. Better as a day pacifier though.
