My son really likes the Avent Pacifiers that is shaped like a sideways figure 8.  Those have air flow and doesn't squash my son's nose.  However with this one, if my son puts it in upside down, it will squish my son's nose. I read about the length of time the glow in the dark feature lasts, and all of the reviews are correct...it doesn't last that long.  I think the sideways figure 8 Avent Pacifiers are better.
