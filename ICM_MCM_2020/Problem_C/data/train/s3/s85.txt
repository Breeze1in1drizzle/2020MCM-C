I am super picky about my hair dryers.  And while this is not the best one I've ever had (my favorite was an 1875 watt Helen of Troy Professional that died several years ago), it's not bad.  Unfortunately, in this day and age, the only dryers I can seem to find are ionic ones.  For me ionic dryers = flat hair.  So, with the choices so limited, this dryer is decent.  I wish it had slow fan speed with high heat, but I can't be too choosy at this point.
