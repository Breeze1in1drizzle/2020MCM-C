The main reason I bought this hair dryer 2 years age, it's because it was advertised as being quiet. (I can't stand noisy hair dryers) and although it's not as quiet as I expected, it is quieter than all of the other ones I've bought.  It's has great power, it's light, easy to handle and it leaves my hair smooth and shinny.  2 Weeks ago it started to fail, I couldn't turn it off, so I'd just unplug it, but this morning it completely stopped working.  So over all, I think I did get my money's worth, because I blow dry my hair every single day and it takes about 10 min, so the price is really good vs. the quality. I even bought another one just now.  Hope this helps.
