We got these because we thought Gerber was generally high quality, and they were cute.  While it's not a horrible pacifier, I don't think the unique shape really means anything better for your baby.<br /><br />One issue with these pacifiers is that they are designed to have a certain orientation (i.e. one side is up).  This makes it less convenient for placing the pacifier in the child's mouth because you have to make sure it's the right direction--half the time I'm flipping it over and then giving it to him, rather than just giving it to him.  This is especially annoying in two cases:<br />1) He puts the pacifier in his mouth himself, and<br />2) You're trying to give the pacifier at night in bed or in the car and you have less ability to see what's going on<br /><br />Since I think the orthodontics is pretty much a gimmick, it probably doesn't really matter which way it's oriented, but even for someone like me it's a little distracting to think it's upside down.<br /><br />The second issue with these pacifiers is the back is designed with a slit in them so that when you wash them water gets into the nipple and makes a squishing noise afterwards.  If you set them on their back for a while they do eventually dry/drain, so it's not a deal-breaker, but it does require extra time before being able to use it again.
