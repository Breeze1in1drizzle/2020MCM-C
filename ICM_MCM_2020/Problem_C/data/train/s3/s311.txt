I like Sharp Microwaves. My mother had one for 40 years and I have had one for 30 years before both required repair. My microwave needed a new magnetron and fuse which I fixed for $125.00. My mother's microwave had to be replaced as we could not find all of the replacement parts we needed. Hence, I purchased the one above- almost an exact replacement. It works very well and is easy to use, but I am not happy with the outward appearance. Too much black and it looks cheap compared to her original one.
