First off, I don't know why Amazon is so expensive on this unit. I just bought one today at a big box store at their regular price of $250. I bought the prior model to this one a little less than 4 yrs ago when I bought my new construction house and upgraded to stainless appliances. One day it worked fine, the next it would act like it was working, but the food wouldn't heat up. Microwaves are supposed to last approximately 9 yrs. I am not happy about having to spend another $250 after just barely 4 yrs. Shame on Whirlpool for making disposable appliances nowadays. I will say it is a nice looking microwave, but I agree with other reviews that the fan is useless. No suction at all if you place your hand under the filter. I also don't understand why most microwaves are rated at 1000 watts and every frozen dinner on the planet says it is tested with an 1100 watt unit. ???    On another note regarding Whirlpool in general I have the following to say. I bought all Whirlpool appliances when I bought my house and I will never spend another dime on Whirlpool again. The only reason I bought the Whirlpool microwave replacement is because my house is for sale and I don't want mismatched appliances. When the washer and dryer were delivered and installed the dryer had a noticeable knocking sound that the delivery guys blamed on flat drum rollers. The front load washer has a ridiculous time trying to balance a load during the spin cycle. The refrigerator has more sharp edges that I have cut myself on in the door compartments than you can shake a stick at. It also doesn't cool down a 12 pk of beer in any less than 12 hrs. I tried to cook a ham in the oven and followed the directions based on weight and temperature....cold ham! The dishwasher is ok but I hate the silverware basket. Not big enough for utensils with large handles. Whirlpool needs to wake up and build quality products that are functional and last. Never again. I will buy Bosch, LG, Samsung or spend the extra money onMiele next time.
