My son loved this pacifier, until the tip broke off out of nowhere, thankfully not while it was in his mouth. We had 2 of these, and even the second one that had not broken had lines where you could tell it was worn and could break at any time. I contacted the company, but received no response. After reading the box, it states to change the pacifier every 6-8 weeks (which of course we hadn't, it had been 5 months with 2 pacifiers) so apparently natural rubber isn't the strongest material.
