This seems ok so far, although the baby is not here yet to put it to the real test.  It's definitely cute and comical.  I didn't like that it came in a little cellophane wrapper as opposed to an acutal package.  It's kind of hard to tell if you got what you paid for when there is no packaging.  It appears sturdy and I don't think it will give us any trouble, but I really would have liked atual packaging.  I think it would be a cute gift, but would never give someone some random pacifier in a cellophane wrapper.
