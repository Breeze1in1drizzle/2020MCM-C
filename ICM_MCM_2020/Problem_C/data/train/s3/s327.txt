Overall, the appearance of this item looks great! However, I just installed this and there seems to be a problem with the drawer closing properly. Essentially, when one uses the close button or attempts to close the drawer manually, it closes but then immediately reopens. I found a way around this until a service agent can come to fix it which is to hold it closed so it does not reopen. There is a little trick to it and it has to do with timing of when to hold it shut. I did warm up a biscuit in it and it worked beautifully, otherwise!
