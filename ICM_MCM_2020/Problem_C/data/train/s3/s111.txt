Very nice hairdryer. It is a little heavy, but you get used to it after a while. Gives a lot of power, so your hair dries quickly. Concentrator is included, so it helps prevent frizz. My hair does get a little frizzy after this, but it is not as bad as with other hair dryers. There are 3 settings and a Cool Shot button.
