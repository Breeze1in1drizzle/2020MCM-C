WOW am I ever surprised! The product descriptions states &#34;Spacious 2.0 cu. ft. interior Accommodates a wide range of meal and snack items&#34; this spacious interior is in reality 1.4 cubic feet!!!. LG's claim of 2 cubic feet include all of the little indentations on the sides and bottom So perhaps this unit has a 2 cubic feet capacity .. if you laid it on it's back drilled a hole in the door and poured in 2 cubic feet of liquid! Well so much for honesty in advertising ... I'll write another review when i actually start using my small microwave but for now I feel duped.
