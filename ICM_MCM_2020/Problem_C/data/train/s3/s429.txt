I push down the button and the little light comes on.  That means it's working, right?  Well, I can't honestly be sure because there is no way to test whether the pacifier is steralized or not.  What I do know, however, is steralization does not equal clean.  A dirty pacifier can be put in this gizmo and come out just as dirty.  So if there is dried milk or anything else on the pacifier, clean it first.<br /><br />Regarding the steralizer's construction, it appears fairly simplistic, maybe even cheap.  Plastic parts that just scream easily broken appear to constitute the entire device, but I could be wrong because I'm not going to waste time reverse engineering it.<br /><br />It's peace of mind, nothing more.
