It does what I bought it to do: boil water and heat leftovers. As stated in other reviews, it heats VERY unevenly. Since I only plan on having this microwave for a year or a year and a half, I went into this purchase willing to put up with such an inconvenience.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good microwave, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a cheap microwave that will hold you over until you can buy something bigger and better, go ahead.
