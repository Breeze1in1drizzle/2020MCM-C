[[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti by Conair 223XR, 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic 2-in-1 Styler, Cord Reel Dryer]]<br /><br />I bought this hairdryer from Amazon in July 2011 for $27.19 including the tax. It is now April 2012 and the cord stopped retracting. I just called Conair Customer Service and in order for them to repair it (at no charge), I must send it to them, at my own expense and must send them $7 for return shipping and they will repair it and return it to me.  I was going to do it, not having a clue what I would do without a hairdryer in the interim, when I checked Amazon again, and saw that I could buy a brand new one for $19.25 with no tax and, of course, free shipping. Obviously, that was the option I chose.<br /><br />Although I liked everything about this dryer, I find it very annoying that after only 9 months, I need to replace it. Anything similar in quality and features cost more money so now I will see how long this new one lasts.  This is very disappointing.
