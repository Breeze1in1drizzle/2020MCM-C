Since I am using this on almost a daily basis (to take to and from the gym) I find it to be a little more heavy than I would prefer.  However, it works well and dries pretty quickly with minimal frizz.  I like that it has the cool shot option.  I ended up getting the Baby Bliss travel dryer because it is about 1/2 the weight and I really like it.  However, it doesn't have the cool temp option so I'm hanging onto this one for backup.
