Wubbanubs are really neat products. They're cute, easy to find in the dark, and weigh down the pacifier enough so baby can't spit it halfway across the room. Now that our baby's four months old, if he loses the pacifier, he can just grab the little plush and return it to his mouth.<br /><br />However, cleaning the pacifier is a huge issue. The tag claims the whole thing can just be thrown in the washer. That works great for the plush, but not for the pacifier. Even though I made sure to clean the pacifier thoroughly afterwards, the baby gagged and kept spitting it out until I'd washed it a few more times. I guess there was still detergent or something clinging to it.<br /><br />And boiling the pacifier is a pain! You can't drop the plush toy into the boiling water, so you have to stand over the pot and just hold it for five minutes. Also, the last time I did that, I think I held it a little too close, because the plush caught fire. Oops.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is a really cute product and makes an awesome shower gift, but it would be much less hassle if you could switch out pacifiers.
