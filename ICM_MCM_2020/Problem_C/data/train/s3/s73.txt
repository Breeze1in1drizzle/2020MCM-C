I ordered the Andis based on the two speeds, cord holder, and   night light.   After installing, I wanted the higher 1600 W and you need a screwdriver to change the speeds. This is very inconvenient. After finishing the change and using, the cord stretched out and didn't return to it's compact size,leading me to think that's why they may have put the little knob on the side.  The night light is a nice feature.   I am disappointed with the look of the stretched out cord.  I will, leave the dryer on the high speed as it makes no sense  to keep changing the intensity.  Yes, it's quiet. Priced reasonably.
