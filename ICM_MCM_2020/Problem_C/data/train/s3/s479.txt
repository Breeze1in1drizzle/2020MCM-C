The pacifier in the picture is not the one that we received.<br /><br />I normally do not write these types of reviews and don't like it when I see these because it does not review the product.  But I don't want anyone else to go through what I did.<br /><br />The one that we received is the regular Avent, which we can buy in the store for less.  Our daughter does love the regular ones.<br /><br />I noticed that the picture has now been changed (11/15/2011).
