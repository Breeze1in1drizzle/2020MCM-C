The dryer has a very powerful motor, I'll give it that. Unlike some other reviewers, I found that the hot setting was more like a warm. Most significantly, though, it left my hair oily-er than usual! It basically left it limp. I'm confused as to the reason for this, but I'm sending it back, regardless.<br />(Despite hating the condition it left my hair in, it did dry it relatively fast.)
