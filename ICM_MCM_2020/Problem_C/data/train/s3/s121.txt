The dryer works just fine but the switches are ill-designed. The switches are located in an awkward position.    First:  the blue cool button is where your fingers rest so when you are drying hair and easily rest your fingers on the cool button, you blast the dryer on the cool setting.  This is very annoying and you have to get used to not pressing this button.    Second:  in order to turn on /off the dryer and turn the setting to how you want, you have to get used to doing it from an awkward position in the back of the handle where your fingers are holding the dryer.  Once you get used to it, it's not a big deal, but it's constantly annoying trying to turn on/off the dryer from this position.    The power of the dryer is great; it's powerful and the dryer works well but I wish the buttons were designed better so that I didn't always hit the cool button and that the on/off switch were easier to turn the blower on and off.
