I bought this dryer specifically because the handle could collapse and the cord was retractable, which I thought would make it fit in my drawer.  Both features work well but, it still wouldn't fit in the drawer.  This dryer does not get very hot so it takes longer to dry my hair than my previous one.  However, it was a good price and you get what you pay for.  I'll keep it but I would try another model before I bought this again.
