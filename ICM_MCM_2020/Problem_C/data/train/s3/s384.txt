We started out with this pacifier as our doula recommended it and said it was the most compatible with breast feeding.  My son took it and it certainly helped in those early days where he wanted to suck 24-7.  He never could keep it in his mouth though which I chalked up to being so little and perhaps not convinced that he loved the pacifier.  I wasn't convinced I wanted him to love it so that was OK.     Then at 1 month he would scream whenever we gave it to him so we quit.  At 3 months though he started sucking on everything and we broke out the pacifier again.  He could hold it in his mouth for a little while but without careful attention it gets pushed out.  Now at 3.5 months we need a pacifier so that my husband might have a chance of putting the baby to bed when I'm not here to nurse him down.  The soothie falls out so fast that there is no chance it could work to do anything but comfort him when he is really upset.      With some experimentation we have discovered that he needs   a) the shield that is molded to the face.  The soothie shield (and the natursutten [[ASIN:B001AVNK6E Natursutten All-Natural Rubber Orthodontic Pacifier, 0-6 months]] that we tried) bumps up against his nose and gravity makes it more likely to fall out.    b) a more shaped nipple.  The orthodontic ones work but so does the MAM [[ASIN:B00211NRF6 Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone Pacifier - Size 1 - 0-6 months - boy colors]] nipple (which is shaped like a bulb but theoretically compresses to an orthodontic shape, though it doesn't really when I tried it. )  The bulb shape of the MAM seems to be enough to keep it behind his gums which seems to help it stay in too.    We just tried out the MAM and he kept it in his mouth for 30 minutes before pushing it out with his tongue (while playing)!  It also has no top/bottom like the soothie so it is easier to get in his mouth in the dark.    Pacifiers are cheap (except for the Natursutten) so it isn't a big deal to try a few different ones--just because one baby does well with one doesn't mean another one will or won't.  But for us, the MAM worked much better.  I'm wondering if we should have tried it earlier--perhaps it would have been helpful in those fussy early months where he wouldn't take the soothie.
