I really very much liked this hair dryer while it lasted, which was about 6 months.  If I had written the review earlier, I'd have given it 5 stars.  But, suddenly, the high speed fan stopped working, the low speed works, but it's hotter than it was (which scares me a little).  It gets such great reviews, both on Amazon and Consumer Reports.  But why did it die so soon?  My previous cheep hair dryers have always lasted for years!  Now the best Amazon can offer is approx. 50% refund if I send it back since the 30-day return policy is past.
