Base does not fit flat to the wall because of protruding round head screws on back of base. Remove screws before installation. One of these screws had broken it's plastic receiver anyway and was holding nothing. Mounting hardware (1 screw) missing and too small<br />to hold securely anyway. No mounting instructions. No drywall mollies. I actually like the dryer itself. Nice thick cord, decent power on high.  Low setting on the dryer is totally useless . If your handy like me you can make the installation work for a perfect fit.
