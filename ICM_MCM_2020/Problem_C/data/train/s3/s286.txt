I tested this hair dryer against two older models we have. One was a Conair with ceramics in the wind tunnel and ionizer. The other was an older BayBliss hair dryer, also with ceramics but no advertized ionizing properties. I didn't use a towel at all for the tests because I figured, if it works as advertized, the Panasonic should dry out my skin less well too. It seems to work.<br /><br />All three are very good hair dryers. I think the Panasonic did the best job of not fizzing up my hair and leaving it feeling very nice. HOWEVER, it stinks! It smelled like I was blowing melted plastic all around the room. That is not the case when I use either the Conair or the BayBliss. Additionally, while both the others are premium models, neither cost more than $50.<br /><br />I'm going to let the Panasonic air out for a month or so outdoors in the sun. Maybe some of the plastic stink will outgas and it will be a great hair dryer. Many people aren't as sensitive as I am to these plastic odors. If you love that new car smell, especially the smell of mostly plastic interiors after they have baked in the sun with the windows up, you'll love the smell of the Panasonic. I can't stand the smell of Fabreze or Bounce but maybe you think they're wonderful. If so, you'll think this dryer is to die for.<br /><br />I think they have the makings of a very good product. That nanoe technology seems to work. However, I'm concerned that each of those tiny little water droplets is surrounded by plastic particles, making it all the easier to find its way to my lungs. Hopefully, airing out will do the trick but I would still recommend a redesign to keep the hot air away from plastic parts.<br /><br />Addendum: I initially gave the product 5 stars but upon reflection I have decided there is no excuse for putting out a product that runs hot air directly past plastic when companies have been making hair dryers with metal or ceramic coated nozzles for years. Yes, recycling water vapor is a great idea, but don't forget to use the best of older technology as well. Plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch.<br /><br />Update: Because of the smell, I gave the hair dryer away.... to my barber. He uses it frequently and likes it. After more than a year, the bad plastic smell is almost gone.der technology as well. Plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch.
