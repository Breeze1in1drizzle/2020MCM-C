I bought this to use on vacation in Europe, because my blow dryer is too powerful. I have long thick hair, and while it dried most of my hair in pretty decent time, I don't even want to think about how long it would have taken me to actually blow it out with a round brush. Good if you just want to dry it off so you can flat iron it or curl it, but I don't recommend if you actually want to style it using the blow dryer.
